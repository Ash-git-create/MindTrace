Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers.

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': "People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

They\'re stuck in something.”\n\nPsychedelic assisted therapy helps clients get unstuck. Emerging research shows that this method helps create new windows of neuroplasticity in the brain to form new pathways and connections.\n\nTo illustrate how those changes work, Schutter recalls a story from a first responder he treated when he was practicing as a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor. Schutter was primarily treating the physical symptoms where the trauma was in their client’s body. During the treatments, the first responder would have an emotional response, recalling and feeling traumatic events from the past. In this scenario, the first responder was on a call and one of their crew members was killed in the line of duty.\n\nEach time survivors recall these incidents, they can feel like they’re drowning in dread and what ifs. But through psychedelic assisted therapy, the survivor can change his thinking and emotions from ‘Why me?’ to ‘I did the best I could.’ It’s a transformative process of self-forgiveness that allows for acceptance and ultimately, peace of mind.\n\nQi’s treatments provide a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for. Photo supplied by Qi Integrated Health\n\nQi Integrated Health offers several psychedelic assisted therapy programs, depending on the client’s needs and diagnosis. From a transformative dose to a lower talk therapy dose, they are committed to improving accessibility to this form of care.\n\n“When you come out of the experience, a therapist is there to help you to make sense of your new insights so that you have a new way of thinking and break the cycle,” Schutter says.\n\nThe full process takes a few weeks, starting with a pre-screening with Qi’s Psychedelic Concierge, and intakes and consultations with their accredited medical and therapeutic team. These sessions aim to unpack what a client needs to move on from: sharing, grounding, blood pressure checks, meditative practice, breath work and reviewing intentions are all taken care of.\n\nOn the treatment day, clients are welcomed by one of Qi’s nurse facilitators and the therapist they have been consulting with. The client enters the Grove, the purpose-built psychedelic space where the medication intake segment of the treatment will take place. Here, clients will settle into a luxurious daybed with a weighted blanket, and will also receive eye shades, personal headsets and a curated playlist carefully designed to match the arch of their treatment journey.\n\n\n\nOverall, it\'s a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for.\n\n\n\n“It\'s a deeply internal experience so that you can get in touch with your inner healing intelligence,” Schutter says. “That voice inside helps guide you on the journey and shows you the parts of yourself that need to have light shone on and an understanding gleaned.”\n\nThe treatment concludes with a thoughtfully-prepared food platter and a reflection session with a therapist.\n\n"Robert," a pseudonym used to protect his identity, is a client of Qi Integrated Health whose career included time in the military and in the police force. He suffered from PTSD, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder and severe insomnia. Robert had tried numerous treatment models unsuccessfully before arriving at Qi Integrated Health.\n\n“The therapy provided a level of relief that I had never known before,” Robert says. “It allowed me to view my life through a new lens, bringing clarity, gratitude and a renewed sense of hope. This profound shift has significantly improved my mental health, my mindset and truly changed my life.”\n\nFor more information, visit www.qiintegratedhealth.com.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-09T14:30:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/sponsored/vancouver-clinic-innovative-approach-to-mental-health-treatments-10755914'}

Please include your full name, daytime phone number and address (for verification of authorship, not publication). The following is in response to \'Son of woman who inspired assisted dying law chooses to die on his own terms,\' published May 31.\n\nThis recent article presents a deeply personal and emotional account, and while the individual pain and struggle described deserve compassion, I feel compelled to express concern over the growing normalization of assisted dying in Canada.\n\nAccording to national statistics, medical assistance in dying (MAiD) is becoming increasingly common. In 2023 alone, over 19,600 people applied for MAiD, and more than 15,300 were approved. These numbers are not just statistics—they reflect a profound shift in our society’s approach to suffering, care, and the value of life itself.\n\nWhile some view this as a compassionate choice, we must consider the broader implications. As assisted dying becomes more accessible, it can subtly pressure vulnerable populations — the elderly, disabled, mentally ill, or economically disadvantaged — to see death as a solution rather than being supported to live with dignity. What starts as a "choice" can become a dangerous expectation.\n\nLife is an invaluable gift, and its sanctity should be upheld, even amidst suffering. When society begins to accept assisted dying as a solution, we risk undermining our collective responsibility to provide care, support, and hope to those in distress. It\'s essential to remember that moments of despair can cloud judgment, and with appropriate support, individuals often find renewed purpose and strength.\n\nThere are stories of individuals who sought assisted death but, after receiving proper care or emotional support, chose to continue living and found meaning in their remaining time. One such case involved a man who withdrew his request after palliative measures were initiated and he found them to be sufficient.\n\nFrom an Islamic perspective, life is a sacred trust from God, not ours to end at will. While suffering is never easy, it is through endurance, healing, and care for one another that we discover strength, resilience, and community. We are taught to respond to suffering not by ending life but by providing more compassion, more care, and more hope.\n\nCanada must ensure that our efforts go toward improving palliative care, mental health resources, and social support systems so that no one feels death is the only dignified option. This is not just a moral concern — it’s a collective responsibility of society as a whole.\n\nTahira Chaudhry\n\nBradford', 'timestamp': '2025-06-09T14:00:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.bradfordtoday.ca/letters-to-the-editor/letter-normalizing-assisted-death-is-not-normal-10764339'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': "People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

With a large patient care base of over 25,000, Qi was perfectly positioned to enter the mental health space. They have helped hundreds of clients reclaim their peace of mind with treatments like naturopathic medicine, traditional chinese medicine, physiotherapy, massage therapy and more.\n\n“Most of the time, our clients feel a loss of connection from their family, from their purpose or their community,” says Qi Integrated Health’s founder and CEO Kiem Schutter. “They feel deeply unsatisfied, depressed, anxious, lost in thought, unmotivated and they can\'t create change. They\'re stuck in something.”\n\nPsychedelic assisted therapy helps clients get unstuck. Emerging research shows that this method helps create new windows of neuroplasticity in the brain to form new pathways and connections.\n\nTo illustrate how those changes work, Schutter recalls a story from a first responder he treated when he was practicing as a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor. Schutter was primarily treating the physical symptoms where the trauma was in their client’s body. During the treatments, the first responder would have an emotional response, recalling and feeling traumatic events from the past. In this scenario, the first responder was on a call and one of their crew members was killed in the line of duty.\n\nEach time survivors recall these incidents, they can feel like they’re drowning in dread and what ifs. But through psychedelic assisted therapy, the survivor can change his thinking and emotions from ‘Why me?’ to ‘I did the best I could.’ It’s a transformative process of self-forgiveness that allows for acceptance and ultimately, peace of mind.\n\nQi’s treatments provide a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for. Photo supplied by Qi Integrated Health\n\nQi Integrated Health offers several psychedelic assisted therapy programs, depending on the client’s needs and diagnosis. From a transformative dose to a lower talk therapy dose, they are committed to improving accessibility to this form of care.\n\n“When you come out of the experience, a therapist is there to help you to make sense of your new insights so that you have a new way of thinking and break the cycle,” Schutter says.\n\nThe full process takes a few weeks, starting with a pre-screening with Qi’s Psychedelic Concierge, and intakes and consultations with their accredited medical and therapeutic team. These sessions aim to unpack what a client needs to move on from: sharing, grounding, blood pressure checks, meditative practice, breath work and reviewing intentions are all taken care of.\n\nOn the treatment day, clients are welcomed by one of Qi’s nurse facilitators and the therapist they have been consulting with. The client enters the Grove, the purpose-built psychedelic space where the medication intake segment of the treatment will take place. Here, clients will settle into a luxurious daybed with a weighted blanket, and will also receive eye shades, personal headsets and a curated playlist carefully designed to match the arch of their treatment journey.\n\n\n\nOverall, it\'s a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for.\n\n\n\n“It\'s a deeply internal experience so that you can get in touch with your inner healing intelligence,” Schutter says. “That voice inside helps guide you on the journey and shows you the parts of yourself that need to have light shone on and an understanding gleaned.”\n\nThe treatment concludes with a thoughtfully-prepared food platter and a reflection session with a therapist.\n\n"Robert," a pseudonym used to protect his identity, is a client of Qi Integrated Health whose career included time in the military and in the police force. He suffered from PTSD, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder and severe insomnia. Robert had tried numerous treatment models unsuccessfully before arriving at Qi Integrated Health.\n\n“The therapy provided a level of relief that I had never known before,” Robert says. “It allowed me to view my life through a new lens, bringing clarity, gratitude and a renewed sense of hope. This profound shift has significantly improved my mental health, my mindset and truly changed my life.”\n\nFor more information, visit www.qiintegratedhealth.com.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-09T14:30:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/sponsored/vancouver-clinic-innovative-approach-to-mental-health-treatments-10755914'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': "People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

With a large patient care base of over 25,000, Qi was perfectly positioned to enter the mental health space. They have helped hundreds of clients reclaim their peace of mind with treatments like naturopathic medicine, traditional chinese medicine, physiotherapy, massage therapy and more.\n\n“Most of the time, our clients feel a loss of connection from their family, from their purpose or their community,” says Qi Integrated Health’s founder and CEO Kiem Schutter. “They feel deeply unsatisfied, depressed, anxious, lost in thought, unmotivated and they can\'t create change. They\'re stuck in something.”\n\nPsychedelic assisted therapy helps clients get unstuck. Emerging research shows that this method helps create new windows of neuroplasticity in the brain to form new pathways and connections.\n\nTo illustrate how those changes work, Schutter recalls a story from a first responder he treated when he was practicing as a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor. Schutter was primarily treating the physical symptoms where the trauma was in their client’s body. During the treatments, the first responder would have an emotional response, recalling and feeling traumatic events from the past. In this scenario, the first responder was on a call and one of their crew members was killed in the line of duty.\n\nEach time survivors recall these incidents, they can feel like they’re drowning in dread and what ifs. But through psychedelic assisted therapy, the survivor can change his thinking and emotions from ‘Why me?’ to ‘I did the best I could.’ It’s a transformative process of self-forgiveness that allows for acceptance and ultimately, peace of mind.\n\nQi’s treatments provide a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for. Photo supplied by Qi Integrated Health\n\nQi Integrated Health offers several psychedelic assisted therapy programs, depending on the client’s needs and diagnosis. From a transformative dose to a lower talk therapy dose, they are committed to improving accessibility to this form of care.\n\n“When you come out of the experience, a therapist is there to help you to make sense of your new insights so that you have a new way of thinking and break the cycle,” Schutter says.\n\nThe full process takes a few weeks, starting with a pre-screening with Qi’s Psychedelic Concierge, and intakes and consultations with their accredited medical and therapeutic team. These sessions aim to unpack what a client needs to move on from: sharing, grounding, blood pressure checks, meditative practice, breath work and reviewing intentions are all taken care of.\n\nOn the treatment day, clients are welcomed by one of Qi’s nurse facilitators and the therapist they have been consulting with. The client enters the Grove, the purpose-built psychedelic space where the medication intake segment of the treatment will take place. Here, clients will settle into a luxurious daybed with a weighted blanket, and will also receive eye shades, personal headsets and a curated playlist carefully designed to match the arch of their treatment journey.\n\n\n\nOverall, it\'s a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for.\n\n\n\n“It\'s a deeply internal experience so that you can get in touch with your inner healing intelligence,” Schutter says. “That voice inside helps guide you on the journey and shows you the parts of yourself that need to have light shone on and an understanding gleaned.”\n\nThe treatment concludes with a thoughtfully-prepared food platter and a reflection session with a therapist.\n\n"Robert," a pseudonym used to protect his identity, is a client of Qi Integrated Health whose career included time in the military and in the police force. He suffered from PTSD, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder and severe insomnia. Robert had tried numerous treatment models unsuccessfully before arriving at Qi Integrated Health.\n\n“The therapy provided a level of relief that I had never known before,” Robert says. “It allowed me to view my life through a new lens, bringing clarity, gratitude and a renewed sense of hope. This profound shift has significantly improved my mental health, my mindset and truly changed my life.”\n\nFor more information, visit www.qiintegratedhealth.com.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-09T14:30:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/sponsored/vancouver-clinic-innovative-approach-to-mental-health-treatments-10755914'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

With a large patient care base of over 25,000, Qi was perfectly positioned to enter the mental health space. They have helped hundreds of clients reclaim their peace of mind with treatments like naturopathic medicine, traditional chinese medicine, physiotherapy, massage therapy and more.\n\n“Most of the time, our clients feel a loss of connection from their family, from their purpose or their community,” says Qi Integrated Health’s founder and CEO Kiem Schutter. “They feel deeply unsatisfied, depressed, anxious, lost in thought, unmotivated and they can\'t create change. They\'re stuck in something.”\n\nPsychedelic assisted therapy helps clients get unstuck. Emerging research shows that this method helps create new windows of neuroplasticity in the brain to form new pathways and connections.\n\nTo illustrate how those changes work, Schutter recalls a story from a first responder he treated when he was practicing as a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor. Schutter was primarily treating the physical symptoms where the trauma was in their client’s body. During the treatments, the first responder would have an emotional response, recalling and feeling traumatic events from the past. In this scenario, the first responder was on a call and one of their crew members was killed in the line of duty.\n\nEach time survivors recall these incidents, they can feel like they’re drowning in dread and what ifs. But through psychedelic assisted therapy, the survivor can change his thinking and emotions from ‘Why me?’ to ‘I did the best I could.’ It’s a transformative process of self-forgiveness that allows for acceptance and ultimately, peace of mind.\n\nQi’s treatments provide a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for. Photo supplied by Qi Integrated Health\n\nQi Integrated Health offers several psychedelic assisted therapy programs, depending on the client’s needs and diagnosis. From a transformative dose to a lower talk therapy dose, they are committed to improving accessibility to this form of care.\n\n“When you come out of the experience, a therapist is there to help you to make sense of your new insights so that you have a new way of thinking and break the cycle,” Schutter says.\n\nThe full process takes a few weeks, starting with a pre-screening with Qi’s Psychedelic Concierge, and intakes and consultations with their accredited medical and therapeutic team. These sessions aim to unpack what a client needs to move on from: sharing, grounding, blood pressure checks, meditative practice, breath work and reviewing intentions are all taken care of.\n\nOn the treatment day, clients are welcomed by one of Qi’s nurse facilitators and the therapist they have been consulting with. The client enters the Grove, the purpose-built psychedelic space where the medication intake segment of the treatment will take place. Here, clients will settle into a luxurious daybed with a weighted blanket, and will also receive eye shades, personal headsets and a curated playlist carefully designed to match the arch of their treatment journey.\n\n\n\nOverall, it\'s a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for.\n\n\n\n“It\'s a deeply internal experience so that you can get in touch with your inner healing intelligence,” Schutter says. “That voice inside helps guide you on the journey and shows you the parts of yourself that need to have light shone on and an understanding gleaned.”\n\nThe treatment concludes with a thoughtfully-prepared food platter and a reflection session with a therapist.\n\n"Robert," a pseudonym used to protect his identity, is a client of Qi Integrated Health whose career included time in the military and in the police force. He suffered from PTSD, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder and severe insomnia. Robert had tried numerous treatment models unsuccessfully before arriving at Qi Integrated Health.\n\n“The therapy provided a level of relief that I had never known before,” Robert says. “It allowed me to view my life through a new lens, bringing clarity, gratitude and a renewed sense of hope. This profound shift has significantly improved my mental health, my mindset and truly changed my life.”\n\nFor more information, visit www.qiintegratedhealth.com.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-09T14:30:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/sponsored/vancouver-clinic-innovative-approach-to-mental-health-treatments-10755914'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': "People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

With a large patient care base of over 25,000, Qi was perfectly positioned to enter the mental health space. They have helped hundreds of clients reclaim their peace of mind with treatments like naturopathic medicine, traditional chinese medicine, physiotherapy, massage therapy and more.\n\n“Most of the time, our clients feel a loss of connection from their family, from their purpose or their community,” says Qi Integrated Health’s founder and CEO Kiem Schutter. “They feel deeply unsatisfied, depressed, anxious, lost in thought, unmotivated and they can\'t create change. They\'re stuck in something.”\n\nPsychedelic assisted therapy helps clients get unstuck. Emerging research shows that this method helps create new windows of neuroplasticity in the brain to form new pathways and connections.\n\nTo illustrate how those changes work, Schutter recalls a story from a first responder he treated when he was practicing as a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor. Schutter was primarily treating the physical symptoms where the trauma was in their client’s body. During the treatments, the first responder would have an emotional response, recalling and feeling traumatic events from the past. In this scenario, the first responder was on a call and one of their crew members was killed in the line of duty.\n\nEach time survivors recall these incidents, they can feel like they’re drowning in dread and what ifs. But through psychedelic assisted therapy, the survivor can change his thinking and emotions from ‘Why me?’ to ‘I did the best I could.’ It’s a transformative process of self-forgiveness that allows for acceptance and ultimately, peace of mind.\n\nQi’s treatments provide a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for. Photo supplied by Qi Integrated Health\n\nQi Integrated Health offers several psychedelic assisted therapy programs, depending on the client’s needs and diagnosis. From a transformative dose to a lower talk therapy dose, they are committed to improving accessibility to this form of care.\n\n“When you come out of the experience, a therapist is there to help you to make sense of your new insights so that you have a new way of thinking and break the cycle,” Schutter says.\n\nThe full process takes a few weeks, starting with a pre-screening with Qi’s Psychedelic Concierge, and intakes and consultations with their accredited medical and therapeutic team. These sessions aim to unpack what a client needs to move on from: sharing, grounding, blood pressure checks, meditative practice, breath work and reviewing intentions are all taken care of.\n\nOn the treatment day, clients are welcomed by one of Qi’s nurse facilitators and the therapist they have been consulting with. The client enters the Grove, the purpose-built psychedelic space where the medication intake segment of the treatment will take place. Here, clients will settle into a luxurious daybed with a weighted blanket, and will also receive eye shades, personal headsets and a curated playlist carefully designed to match the arch of their treatment journey.\n\n\n\nOverall, it\'s a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for.\n\n\n\n“It\'s a deeply internal experience so that you can get in touch with your inner healing intelligence,” Schutter says. “That voice inside helps guide you on the journey and shows you the parts of yourself that need to have light shone on and an understanding gleaned.”\n\nThe treatment concludes with a thoughtfully-prepared food platter and a reflection session with a therapist.\n\n"Robert," a pseudonym used to protect his identity, is a client of Qi Integrated Health whose career included time in the military and in the police force. He suffered from PTSD, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder and severe insomnia. Robert had tried numerous treatment models unsuccessfully before arriving at Qi Integrated Health.\n\n“The therapy provided a level of relief that I had never known before,” Robert says. “It allowed me to view my life through a new lens, bringing clarity, gratitude and a renewed sense of hope. This profound shift has significantly improved my mental health, my mindset and truly changed my life.”\n\nFor more information, visit www.qiintegratedhealth.com.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-09T14:30:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/sponsored/vancouver-clinic-innovative-approach-to-mental-health-treatments-10755914'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers.

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': "People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

With a large patient care base of over 25,000, Qi was perfectly positioned to enter the mental health space. They have helped hundreds of clients reclaim their peace of mind with treatments like naturopathic medicine, traditional chinese medicine, physiotherapy, massage therapy and more.\n\n“Most of the time, our clients feel a loss of connection from their family, from their purpose or their community,” says Qi Integrated Health’s founder and CEO Kiem Schutter. “They feel deeply unsatisfied, depressed, anxious, lost in thought, unmotivated and they can\'t create change. They\'re stuck in something.”\n\nPsychedelic assisted therapy helps clients get unstuck. Emerging research shows that this method helps create new windows of neuroplasticity in the brain to form new pathways and connections.\n\nTo illustrate how those changes work, Schutter recalls a story from a first responder he treated when he was practicing as a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor. Schutter was primarily treating the physical symptoms where the trauma was in their client’s body. During the treatments, the first responder would have an emotional response, recalling and feeling traumatic events from the past. In this scenario, the first responder was on a call and one of their crew members was killed in the line of duty.\n\nEach time survivors recall these incidents, they can feel like they’re drowning in dread and what ifs. But through psychedelic assisted therapy, the survivor can change his thinking and emotions from ‘Why me?’ to ‘I did the best I could.’ It’s a transformative process of self-forgiveness that allows for acceptance and ultimately, peace of mind.\n\nQi’s treatments provide a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for. Photo supplied by Qi Integrated Health\n\nQi Integrated Health offers several psychedelic assisted therapy programs, depending on the client’s needs and diagnosis. From a transformative dose to a lower talk therapy dose, they are committed to improving accessibility to this form of care.\n\n“When you come out of the experience, a therapist is there to help you to make sense of your new insights so that you have a new way of thinking and break the cycle,” Schutter says.\n\nThe full process takes a few weeks, starting with a pre-screening with Qi’s Psychedelic Concierge, and intakes and consultations with their accredited medical and therapeutic team. These sessions aim to unpack what a client needs to move on from: sharing, grounding, blood pressure checks, meditative practice, breath work and reviewing intentions are all taken care of.\n\nOn the treatment day, clients are welcomed by one of Qi’s nurse facilitators and the therapist they have been consulting with. The client enters the Grove, the purpose-built psychedelic space where the medication intake segment of the treatment will take place. Here, clients will settle into a luxurious daybed with a weighted blanket, and will also receive eye shades, personal headsets and a curated playlist carefully designed to match the arch of their treatment journey.\n\n\n\nOverall, it\'s a beautiful experience where clients feel safe, heard and cared for.\n\n\n\n“It\'s a deeply internal experience so that you can get in touch with your inner healing intelligence,” Schutter says. “That voice inside helps guide you on the journey and shows you the parts of yourself that need to have light shone on and an understanding gleaned.”\n\nThe treatment concludes with a thoughtfully-prepared food platter and a reflection session with a therapist.\n\n"Robert," a pseudonym used to protect his identity, is a client of Qi Integrated Health whose career included time in the military and in the police force. He suffered from PTSD, major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder and severe insomnia. Robert had tried numerous treatment models unsuccessfully before arriving at Qi Integrated Health.\n\n“The therapy provided a level of relief that I had never known before,” Robert says. “It allowed me to view my life through a new lens, bringing clarity, gratitude and a renewed sense of hope. This profound shift has significantly improved my mental health, my mindset and truly changed my life.”\n\nFor more information, visit www.qiintegratedhealth.com.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-09T14:30:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/sponsored/vancouver-clinic-innovative-approach-to-mental-health-treatments-10755914'}

Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve. We should be able to expect better from doctors and experts.”", 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T09:34:06Z', 'url': 'https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/health/doctors-didnt-believe-post-covid-10255609'}
✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': "People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

A history of TBI, in turn, was associated with evidence of adverse mental health outcomes.\n\n“These observations offer initial insights into the potential lifelong brain health consequences of intimate partner violence with physical abuse.\n\n“Given the global prevalence of intimate partner violence, particularly among women, these findings highlight a pressing need for further research in this field, as well as for targeted interventions to raise awareness among policymakers and medical professionals about the potential impact of intimate partner violence with physical abuse on health outcomes across the lifespan.”\n\nThe work was funded by the Drake Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Medical Research Council, NHS Research Scotland, the Alzheimer’s Society, and the Alzheimer’s Association.\n\nProf Willie Stewart said: “Given its prevalence, these findings highlight domestic violence as a public health issue with potential for long-lasting impacts on brain health.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA man was locked in a psychiatric ward and accused of being delusional after developing a terrifying condition he believes was triggered by Covid. Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve. We should be able to expect better from doctors and experts.”", 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T09:34:06Z', 'url': 'https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/health/doctors-didnt-believe-post-covid-10255609'}
✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve.

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve.

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve.

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': "People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve. We should be able to expect better from doctors and experts.”", 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T09:34:06Z', 'url': 'https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/health/doctors-didnt-believe-post-covid-10255609'}
✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': "People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating.

A history of TBI, in turn, was associated with evidence of adverse mental health outcomes.\n\n“These observations offer initial insights into the potential lifelong brain health consequences of intimate partner violence with physical abuse.\n\n“Given the global prevalence of intimate partner violence, particularly among women, these findings highlight a pressing need for further research in this field, as well as for targeted interventions to raise awareness among policymakers and medical professionals about the potential impact of intimate partner violence with physical abuse on health outcomes across the lifespan.”\n\nThe work was funded by the Drake Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Medical Research Council, NHS Research Scotland, the Alzheimer’s Society, and the Alzheimer’s Association.\n\nProf Willie Stewart said: “Given its prevalence, these findings highlight domestic violence as a public health issue with potential for long-lasting impacts on brain health.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA man was locked in a psychiatric ward and accused of being delusional after developing a terrifying condition he believes was triggered by Covid. Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve. We should be able to expect better from doctors and experts.”", 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T09:34:06Z', 'url': 'https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/health/doctors-didnt-believe-post-covid-10255609'}
✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': 'John Oldham redefines the landscape of personality disorders', 'text': 'In a comprehensive Genomic Press Interview published today in Brain Medicine, John M. Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

✅ Produced: {'source': 'gnews', 'title': "People's mental health often improves after weight-loss surgery. A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n"It really is the norm," Larissa McGarrity , a clinical psychologist at University of Utah Health who studies mental health after weight-loss surgery.\n\nHuett\'s experience of facing weight stigma even after surgery — and that affecting her mental health — is also common.\n\nNew research by McGarrity and colleagues suggests that this stigma affects how patients fare after bariatric surgery. Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve. We should be able to expect better from doctors and experts.”", 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T09:34:06Z', 'url': 'https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/health/doctors-didnt-believe-post-covid-10255609'}

Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Huett feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Huett told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Huett felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Huett underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nHuett\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Huett faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Huett\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Huett said.\n\nHuett says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Huett said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T20:15:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/peoples-mental-health-often-improves-after-weight-loss-surgery-a-study-pinpoints-the-real-reason-why'}/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py:1207: UnknownTimezoneWarning: tzname IST identified but not understood.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

Ron DeSantis signed it into law on May 30, 2025. The same bill calls for high schools in six Florida districts to adopt the ban during the upcoming school year and produce a report on its effectiveness by Dec. 1, 2026.\n\nParents are divided on the issue. According to a report from Education Week, many parents want their kids to have phones for safety reasons – and don’t support bans as a result.\n\nBut in the debate over whether phones should be banned in K-12 schools – and if so, how – students themselves are rarely given a voice.\n\nWe are experts in media use and public health who surveyed 1,510 kids ages 11 to 13 in Florida in November and December 2024 to learn how they’re using digital media and the role tech plays in their lives at home and at school. Their responses were insightful – and occasionally surprising.\n\nAdults generally cite four reasons to ban phone use during school: to improve kids’ mental health, to strengthen academic outcomes, to reduce cyberbullying and to help limit kids’ overall screen time.\n\nBut as our survey shows, it may be a bit much to expect a cellphone ban to accomplish all of that.\n\nWhat do kids want?\n\nSome of the questions in our survey shine light on kids’ feelings toward banning cellphones – even though we didn’t ask that question directly.\n\nWe asked them if they feel relief when they’re in a situation where they can’t use their smartphone, and 31% said yes.\n\nAdditionally, 34% of kids agreed with the statement that social media causes more harm than good.\n\nAnd kids were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to agree with those statements if they attended schools where phones are banned or confiscated for most of the school day, with use only permitted at certain times. That group covered 70% of the students we surveyed because many individual schools or school districts in Florida have already limited students’ cellphone use.\n\nHow students use cellphones matters\n\nSome “power users” of cellphone apps could likely use a break from them.\n\nTwenty percent of children we surveyed said push notifications on their phones — that is, notifications from apps that pop up on the phone’s screen — are never turned off. These notifications are likely coming from the most popular apps kids reported using, like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.\n\nThis 20% of children was roughly three times more likely to report experiencing anxiety than kids who rarely or never have their notifications on.\n\nThey were also nearly five times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids whose notifications are always or sometimes off.\n\nOur survey results also suggest phone bans would likely have positive effects on grades and mental health among some of the heaviest screen users. For example, 22% of kids reported using their favorite app for six or more hours per day. These students were three times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids who spend an hour or less on their favorite app each day.\n\nThey also were six times more likely than hour-or-less users to report severe depression symptoms. These insights remained even after ruling out numerous other possible explanations for the difference — like age, household income, gender, parent’s education, race and ethnicity.\n\nBanning students’ access to phones at school means these kids would not receive notifications for at least that seven-hour period and have fewer hours in the day to use apps.\n\nPhones and mental health\n\nHowever, other data we collected suggests that bans aren’t a universal benefit for all children.\n\nSeventeen percent of kids who attend schools that ban or confiscate phones report severe depression symptoms, compared with just 4% among kids who keep their phones with them during the school day.\n\nThis finding held even after we ruled out other potential explanations for what we were seeing, such as the type of school students attend and other demographic factors.\n\nWe are not suggesting that our survey shows phone bans cause mental health problems.\n\nIt is possible, for instance, that the schools where kids already were struggling with their mental health simply happened to be the ones that have banned phones. Also, our survey didn’t ask kids how long phones have been banned at their schools. If the bans just launched, there may be positive effects on mental health or grades yet to come.\n\nIn order to get a better sense of the bans’ effects on mental health, we would need to examine mental health indicators before and after phone bans.\n\nTo get a long-term view on this question, we are planning to do a nationwide survey of digital media use and mental health, starting with 11- to 13-year-olds and tracking them into adulthood.\n\nEven with the limitations of our data from this survey, however, we can conclude that banning phones in schools is unlikely to be an immediate solution to mental health problems of kids ages 11-13.\n\nGrades up, cyberbullying down\n\nStudents at schools where phones are barred or confiscated didn’t report earning higher grades than children at schools where kids keep their phones.\n\nThis finding held for students at both private and public schools, and even after ruling out other possible explanations like differences in gender and household income, since these factors are also known to affect grades.\n\nThere are limits to our findings here: Grades are not a perfect measure of learning, and they’re not standardized across schools. It’s possible that kids at phone-free schools are in fact learning more than those at schools where kids carry their phones around during school hours – even if they earn the same grades.\n\nWe asked kids how often in the past three months they’d experienced mistreatment online – like being called hurtful names or having lies or rumors spread about them. Kids at schools where phone use is limited during school hours actually reported enduring more cyberbullying than children at schools with less restrictive policies. This result persisted even after we considered smartphone ownership and numerous demographics as possible explanations.\n\nWe are not necessarily saying that cellphone bans cause an increase in cyberbullying. What could be at play here is that at schools where cyberbullying has been particularly bad, phones have been banned or are confiscated, and online bullying still occurs.\n\nBut based on our survey results, it does not appear that school phone bans prevent cyberbullying.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that banning phones in schools may not be an easy fix for students’ mental health problems, poor academic performance or cyberbullying.\n\nThat said, kids might benefit from phone-free schools in ways that we have not explored, like increased attention spans or reduced eyestrain.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:00:00Z', 'url': 'https://theconversation.com/we-surveyed-1-500-florida-kids-about-cellphones-and-their-mental-health-what-we-learned-suggests-school-phone-bans-may-have-important-but-limited-effects-256970'}

Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve. We should be able to expect better from doctors and experts.”", 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T09:34:06Z', 'url': 'https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/health/doctors-didnt-believe-post-covid-10255609'}

Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future.

A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Lloyd feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Lloyd told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Lloyd felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Lloyd underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nLloyd\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Lloyd faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Lloyd\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Lloyd said.\n\nLloyd says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Lloyd said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."\n\nEditor\'s note: This story was updated on June 11, 2025, to adjust Autumn Huett\'s name to Llyod, her married name.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

Ron DeSantis signed it into law on May 30, 2025. The same bill calls for high schools in six Florida districts to adopt the ban during the upcoming school year and produce a report on its effectiveness by Dec. 1, 2026.\n\nParents are divided on the issue. According to a report from Education Week, many parents want their kids to have phones for safety reasons – and don’t support bans as a result.\n\nBut in the debate over whether phones should be banned in K-12 schools – and if so, how – students themselves are rarely given a voice.\n\nWe are experts in media use and public health who surveyed 1,510 kids ages 11 to 13 in Florida in November and December 2024 to learn how they’re using digital media and the role tech plays in their lives at home and at school. Their responses were insightful – and occasionally surprising.\n\nAdults generally cite four reasons to ban phone use during school: to improve kids’ mental health, to strengthen academic outcomes, to reduce cyberbullying and to help limit kids’ overall screen time.\n\nBut as our survey shows, it may be a bit much to expect a cellphone ban to accomplish all of that.\n\nWhat do kids want?\n\nSome of the questions in our survey shine light on kids’ feelings toward banning cellphones – even though we didn’t ask that question directly.\n\nWe asked them if they feel relief when they’re in a situation where they can’t use their smartphone, and 31% said yes.\n\nAdditionally, 34% of kids agreed with the statement that social media causes more harm than good.\n\nAnd kids were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to agree with those statements if they attended schools where phones are banned or confiscated for most of the school day, with use only permitted at certain times. That group covered 70% of the students we surveyed because many individual schools or school districts in Florida have already limited students’ cellphone use.\n\nHow students use cellphones matters\n\nSome “power users” of cellphone apps could likely use a break from them.\n\nTwenty percent of children we surveyed said push notifications on their phones — that is, notifications from apps that pop up on the phone’s screen — are never turned off. These notifications are likely coming from the most popular apps kids reported using, like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.\n\nThis 20% of children was roughly three times more likely to report experiencing anxiety than kids who rarely or never have their notifications on.\n\nThey were also nearly five times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids whose notifications are always or sometimes off.\n\nOur survey results also suggest phone bans would likely have positive effects on grades and mental health among some of the heaviest screen users. For example, 22% of kids reported using their favorite app for six or more hours per day. These students were three times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids who spend an hour or less on their favorite app each day.\n\nThey also were six times more likely than hour-or-less users to report severe depression symptoms. These insights remained even after ruling out numerous other possible explanations for the difference — like age, household income, gender, parent’s education, race and ethnicity.\n\nBanning students’ access to phones at school means these kids would not receive notifications for at least that seven-hour period and have fewer hours in the day to use apps.\n\nPhones and mental health\n\nHowever, other data we collected suggests that bans aren’t a universal benefit for all children.\n\nSeventeen percent of kids who attend schools that ban or confiscate phones report severe depression symptoms, compared with just 4% among kids who keep their phones with them during the school day.\n\nThis finding held even after we ruled out other potential explanations for what we were seeing, such as the type of school students attend and other demographic factors.\n\nWe are not suggesting that our survey shows phone bans cause mental health problems.\n\nIt is possible, for instance, that the schools where kids already were struggling with their mental health simply happened to be the ones that have banned phones. Also, our survey didn’t ask kids how long phones have been banned at their schools. If the bans just launched, there may be positive effects on mental health or grades yet to come.\n\nIn order to get a better sense of the bans’ effects on mental health, we would need to examine mental health indicators before and after phone bans.\n\nTo get a long-term view on this question, we are planning to do a nationwide survey of digital media use and mental health, starting with 11- to 13-year-olds and tracking them into adulthood.\n\nEven with the limitations of our data from this survey, however, we can conclude that banning phones in schools is unlikely to be an immediate solution to mental health problems of kids ages 11-13.\n\nGrades up, cyberbullying down\n\nStudents at schools where phones are barred or confiscated didn’t report earning higher grades than children at schools where kids keep their phones.\n\nThis finding held for students at both private and public schools, and even after ruling out other possible explanations like differences in gender and household income, since these factors are also known to affect grades.\n\nThere are limits to our findings here: Grades are not a perfect measure of learning, and they’re not standardized across schools. It’s possible that kids at phone-free schools are in fact learning more than those at schools where kids carry their phones around during school hours – even if they earn the same grades.\n\nWe asked kids how often in the past three months they’d experienced mistreatment online – like being called hurtful names or having lies or rumors spread about them. Kids at schools where phone use is limited during school hours actually reported enduring more cyberbullying than children at schools with less restrictive policies. This result persisted even after we considered smartphone ownership and numerous demographics as possible explanations.\n\nWe are not necessarily saying that cellphone bans cause an increase in cyberbullying. What could be at play here is that at schools where cyberbullying has been particularly bad, phones have been banned or are confiscated, and online bullying still occurs.\n\nBut based on our survey results, it does not appear that school phone bans prevent cyberbullying.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that banning phones in schools may not be an easy fix for students’ mental health problems, poor academic performance or cyberbullying.\n\nThat said, kids might benefit from phone-free schools in ways that we have not explored, like increased attention spans or reduced eyestrain.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:00:00Z', 'url': 'https://theconversation.com/we-surveyed-1-500-florida-kids-about-cellphones-and-their-mental-health-what-we-learned-suggests-school-phone-bans-may-have-important-but-limited-effects-256970'}

Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve. We should be able to expect better from doctors and experts.”", 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T09:34:06Z', 'url': 'https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/health/doctors-didnt-believe-post-covid-10255609'}

Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Lloyd feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Lloyd told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Lloyd felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Lloyd underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nLloyd\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Lloyd faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Lloyd\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Lloyd said.\n\nLloyd says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Lloyd said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."\n\nEditor\'s note: This story was updated on June 11, 2025, to adjust Autumn Huett\'s name to Llyod, her married name.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

Ron DeSantis signed it into law on May 30, 2025. The same bill calls for high schools in six Florida districts to adopt the ban during the upcoming school year and produce a report on its effectiveness by Dec. 1, 2026.\n\nParents are divided on the issue. According to a report from Education Week, many parents want their kids to have phones for safety reasons – and don’t support bans as a result.\n\nBut in the debate over whether phones should be banned in K-12 schools – and if so, how – students themselves are rarely given a voice.\n\nWe are experts in media use and public health who surveyed 1,510 kids ages 11 to 13 in Florida in November and December 2024 to learn how they’re using digital media and the role tech plays in their lives at home and at school. Their responses were insightful – and occasionally surprising.\n\nAdults generally cite four reasons to ban phone use during school: to improve kids’ mental health, to strengthen academic outcomes, to reduce cyberbullying and to help limit kids’ overall screen time.\n\nBut as our survey shows, it may be a bit much to expect a cellphone ban to accomplish all of that.\n\nWhat do kids want?\n\nSome of the questions in our survey shine light on kids’ feelings toward banning cellphones – even though we didn’t ask that question directly.\n\nWe asked them if they feel relief when they’re in a situation where they can’t use their smartphone, and 31% said yes.\n\nAdditionally, 34% of kids agreed with the statement that social media causes more harm than good.\n\nAnd kids were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to agree with those statements if they attended schools where phones are banned or confiscated for most of the school day, with use only permitted at certain times. That group covered 70% of the students we surveyed because many individual schools or school districts in Florida have already limited students’ cellphone use.\n\nHow students use cellphones matters\n\nSome “power users” of cellphone apps could likely use a break from them.\n\nTwenty percent of children we surveyed said push notifications on their phones — that is, notifications from apps that pop up on the phone’s screen — are never turned off. These notifications are likely coming from the most popular apps kids reported using, like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.\n\nThis 20% of children was roughly three times more likely to report experiencing anxiety than kids who rarely or never have their notifications on.\n\nThey were also nearly five times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids whose notifications are always or sometimes off.\n\nOur survey results also suggest phone bans would likely have positive effects on grades and mental health among some of the heaviest screen users. For example, 22% of kids reported using their favorite app for six or more hours per day. These students were three times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids who spend an hour or less on their favorite app each day.\n\nThey also were six times more likely than hour-or-less users to report severe depression symptoms. These insights remained even after ruling out numerous other possible explanations for the difference — like age, household income, gender, parent’s education, race and ethnicity.\n\nBanning students’ access to phones at school means these kids would not receive notifications for at least that seven-hour period and have fewer hours in the day to use apps.\n\nPhones and mental health\n\nHowever, other data we collected suggests that bans aren’t a universal benefit for all children.\n\nSeventeen percent of kids who attend schools that ban or confiscate phones report severe depression symptoms, compared with just 4% among kids who keep their phones with them during the school day.\n\nThis finding held even after we ruled out other potential explanations for what we were seeing, such as the type of school students attend and other demographic factors.\n\nWe are not suggesting that our survey shows phone bans cause mental health problems.\n\nIt is possible, for instance, that the schools where kids already were struggling with their mental health simply happened to be the ones that have banned phones. Also, our survey didn’t ask kids how long phones have been banned at their schools. If the bans just launched, there may be positive effects on mental health or grades yet to come.\n\nIn order to get a better sense of the bans’ effects on mental health, we would need to examine mental health indicators before and after phone bans.\n\nTo get a long-term view on this question, we are planning to do a nationwide survey of digital media use and mental health, starting with 11- to 13-year-olds and tracking them into adulthood.\n\nEven with the limitations of our data from this survey, however, we can conclude that banning phones in schools is unlikely to be an immediate solution to mental health problems of kids ages 11-13.\n\nGrades up, cyberbullying down\n\nStudents at schools where phones are barred or confiscated didn’t report earning higher grades than children at schools where kids keep their phones.\n\nThis finding held for students at both private and public schools, and even after ruling out other possible explanations like differences in gender and household income, since these factors are also known to affect grades.\n\nThere are limits to our findings here: Grades are not a perfect measure of learning, and they’re not standardized across schools. It’s possible that kids at phone-free schools are in fact learning more than those at schools where kids carry their phones around during school hours – even if they earn the same grades.\n\nWe asked kids how often in the past three months they’d experienced mistreatment online – like being called hurtful names or having lies or rumors spread about them. Kids at schools where phone use is limited during school hours actually reported enduring more cyberbullying than children at schools with less restrictive policies. This result persisted even after we considered smartphone ownership and numerous demographics as possible explanations.\n\nWe are not necessarily saying that cellphone bans cause an increase in cyberbullying. What could be at play here is that at schools where cyberbullying has been particularly bad, phones have been banned or are confiscated, and online bullying still occurs.\n\nBut based on our survey results, it does not appear that school phone bans prevent cyberbullying.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that banning phones in schools may not be an easy fix for students’ mental health problems, poor academic performance or cyberbullying.\n\nThat said, kids might benefit from phone-free schools in ways that we have not explored, like increased attention spans or reduced eyestrain.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:00:00Z', 'url': 'https://theconversation.com/we-surveyed-1-500-florida-kids-about-cellphones-and-their-mental-health-what-we-learned-suggests-school-phone-bans-may-have-important-but-limited-effects-256970'}

Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve. We should be able to expect better from doctors and experts.”", 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T09:34:06Z', 'url': 'https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/health/doctors-didnt-believe-post-covid-10255609'}

Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers.

A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Lloyd feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Lloyd told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Lloyd felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Lloyd underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nLloyd\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Lloyd faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Lloyd\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Lloyd said.\n\nLloyd says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Lloyd said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."\n\nEditor\'s note: This story was updated on June 11, 2025, to adjust Autumn Huett\'s name to Llyod, her married name.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating. This can even lead to the inability to decide for oneself or make decisions, especially during the times when one goes through depressive episodes.\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nSuch a disorder can be hard to deal with, but with the right care and professional help, one can surely increase the pace of recovery. Other habitual changes can further complement the early improvement.", 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:31:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/mental-health/bipolar-disorder-the-emotional-highs-and-lows-that-trigger-anxiety-and-depression-1228399/'}

Ron DeSantis signed it into law on May 30, 2025. The same bill calls for high schools in six Florida districts to adopt the ban during the upcoming school year and produce a report on its effectiveness by Dec. 1, 2026.\n\nParents are divided on the issue. According to a report from Education Week, many parents want their kids to have phones for safety reasons – and don’t support bans as a result.\n\nBut in the debate over whether phones should be banned in K-12 schools – and if so, how – students themselves are rarely given a voice.\n\nWe are experts in media use and public health who surveyed 1,510 kids ages 11 to 13 in Florida in November and December 2024 to learn how they’re using digital media and the role tech plays in their lives at home and at school. Their responses were insightful – and occasionally surprising.\n\nAdults generally cite four reasons to ban phone use during school: to improve kids’ mental health, to strengthen academic outcomes, to reduce cyberbullying and to help limit kids’ overall screen time.\n\nBut as our survey shows, it may be a bit much to expect a cellphone ban to accomplish all of that.\n\nWhat do kids want?\n\nSome of the questions in our survey shine light on kids’ feelings toward banning cellphones – even though we didn’t ask that question directly.\n\nWe asked them if they feel relief when they’re in a situation where they can’t use their smartphone, and 31% said yes.\n\nAdditionally, 34% of kids agreed with the statement that social media causes more harm than good.\n\nAnd kids were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to agree with those statements if they attended schools where phones are banned or confiscated for most of the school day, with use only permitted at certain times. That group covered 70% of the students we surveyed because many individual schools or school districts in Florida have already limited students’ cellphone use.\n\nHow students use cellphones matters\n\nSome “power users” of cellphone apps could likely use a break from them.\n\nTwenty percent of children we surveyed said push notifications on their phones — that is, notifications from apps that pop up on the phone’s screen — are never turned off. These notifications are likely coming from the most popular apps kids reported using, like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.\n\nThis 20% of children was roughly three times more likely to report experiencing anxiety than kids who rarely or never have their notifications on.\n\nThey were also nearly five times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids whose notifications are always or sometimes off.\n\nOur survey results also suggest phone bans would likely have positive effects on grades and mental health among some of the heaviest screen users. For example, 22% of kids reported using their favorite app for six or more hours per day. These students were three times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids who spend an hour or less on their favorite app each day.\n\nThey also were six times more likely than hour-or-less users to report severe depression symptoms. These insights remained even after ruling out numerous other possible explanations for the difference — like age, household income, gender, parent’s education, race and ethnicity.\n\nBanning students’ access to phones at school means these kids would not receive notifications for at least that seven-hour period and have fewer hours in the day to use apps.\n\nPhones and mental health\n\nHowever, other data we collected suggests that bans aren’t a universal benefit for all children.\n\nSeventeen percent of kids who attend schools that ban or confiscate phones report severe depression symptoms, compared with just 4% among kids who keep their phones with them during the school day.\n\nThis finding held even after we ruled out other potential explanations for what we were seeing, such as the type of school students attend and other demographic factors.\n\nWe are not suggesting that our survey shows phone bans cause mental health problems.\n\nIt is possible, for instance, that the schools where kids already were struggling with their mental health simply happened to be the ones that have banned phones. Also, our survey didn’t ask kids how long phones have been banned at their schools. If the bans just launched, there may be positive effects on mental health or grades yet to come.\n\nIn order to get a better sense of the bans’ effects on mental health, we would need to examine mental health indicators before and after phone bans.\n\nTo get a long-term view on this question, we are planning to do a nationwide survey of digital media use and mental health, starting with 11- to 13-year-olds and tracking them into adulthood.\n\nEven with the limitations of our data from this survey, however, we can conclude that banning phones in schools is unlikely to be an immediate solution to mental health problems of kids ages 11-13.\n\nGrades up, cyberbullying down\n\nStudents at schools where phones are barred or confiscated didn’t report earning higher grades than children at schools where kids keep their phones.\n\nThis finding held for students at both private and public schools, and even after ruling out other possible explanations like differences in gender and household income, since these factors are also known to affect grades.\n\nThere are limits to our findings here: Grades are not a perfect measure of learning, and they’re not standardized across schools. It’s possible that kids at phone-free schools are in fact learning more than those at schools where kids carry their phones around during school hours – even if they earn the same grades.\n\nWe asked kids how often in the past three months they’d experienced mistreatment online – like being called hurtful names or having lies or rumors spread about them. Kids at schools where phone use is limited during school hours actually reported enduring more cyberbullying than children at schools with less restrictive policies. This result persisted even after we considered smartphone ownership and numerous demographics as possible explanations.\n\nWe are not necessarily saying that cellphone bans cause an increase in cyberbullying. What could be at play here is that at schools where cyberbullying has been particularly bad, phones have been banned or are confiscated, and online bullying still occurs.\n\nBut based on our survey results, it does not appear that school phone bans prevent cyberbullying.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that banning phones in schools may not be an easy fix for students’ mental health problems, poor academic performance or cyberbullying.\n\nThat said, kids might benefit from phone-free schools in ways that we have not explored, like increased attention spans or reduced eyestrain.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:00:00Z', 'url': 'https://theconversation.com/we-surveyed-1-500-florida-kids-about-cellphones-and-their-mental-health-what-we-learned-suggests-school-phone-bans-may-have-important-but-limited-effects-256970'}

Brandon Green’s symptoms included extreme sensitivity to light, hives and a range of allergies; he was eventually forced to spend 20 months living in a blacked-out room.\n\nThe 37-year-old contracted Covid in 2020 and says that he was not particularly ill - but the experience was strange.“The virus itself wasn’t too bad” Brandon says, “but it was weird. I could feel something in my brain. For weeks afterwards, my tongue would go numb, my foot would drop for a whole week, I couldn’t speak for hours. I’d blank out mid-conversation. It was like I couldn’t access my brain.”\n\nThe next sign that something was wrong was when he used a supermarket sunscreen on his face and had an unusual reaction.“By the end of the day, I was burnt all over,” he says. “And the following days and weeks, every time I would go out in the sun, I would feel intense burning.”\n\nAs time passed, Brandon’s symptoms worsened. He developed extreme sensitivity to sunlight that felt like being burned by a blowtorch, hives on his skin and a bizarre sensitivity to metal. “I couldn’t sleep on a mattress because the springs would burn me, so I just moved to the floor,” he explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also developed an allergy to mould that left him struggling to breathe and severe sensitivity to electromagnetic radiation, which got worse week by week. By April 2022 he was forced to spend his days in a blacked out room with the curtains taped shut to ensure no light crept in. He was only able to venture out at night and jokes he lived for late night shopping on Thursdays.\n\nBrandon was terrified but trips to the doctors left him feeling hopeless.“Doctors didn’t know what to do and kept saying I was making it up,” he said. “I once had a doctor laugh at me because I said I got relief from acupuncture.”\n\nHe was ill, exhausted and incredibly frustrated when events took a turn for the worse.Worried friends had contacted a psychiatrist who appeared at his door in 2023 to talk to him.\n\nLater that night he had a phone call from the doctor, explaining that he thought he was suffering delusions and that a mental health team was on the way to assess him who then took him to a psychiatric ward.\n\n“As soon as I arrived at the facility, I went out to the basketball court for fresh air, and saw a young guy trying to choke himself with his jumper, wrapping it around his neck and pulling on each end of it,” Brandon said. “I ran and told the nurse and security. By the time they arrived he’d stopped what he was doing, seen me dob on him and the nurse and security weren't impressed with me - explaining that he was fine. I later got a mouthful from the guy.”\n\nStaff wanted to medicate him, but Brandon refused. “They told me I was delusional, that I had schizophrenia. They wanted to pump me full of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. I was scared,” he said.\n\nLocked up with patients with severe mental illness, his condition worsened and he was plagued with asthma attacks. “I kept thinking, this is a place for people with mental illness, but I’m here because they think I’m crazy when really I’m sick.”\n\nAfter two days, he was allowed home, exhausted and bewildered - and with no answers about what was really wrong with him. A few months later there was finally progress.\n\nBrandon’s doctor told him he had Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition where immune cells overreact and release excessive chemical mediators. He was prescribed Mast Cell Stabilising drugs. There have been multiple reports of people developed MCAS after having Covid and a number of specialists believe that the condition can be triggered by the virus.\n\nOver the next few weeks Brandon noticed gradual improvement and by December 2023 - after 20 months of living in the dark - he was finally able to tolerate more light.“By Christmas Day I was fully out,” he says. “A true Christmas miracle.”\n\nBut despite significant improvements, he still struggles with debilitating symptoms that doctors are unable to explain.I want to get better. I want people to understand what I’ve been through,” he says.\n\n“I’ve forgiven my friends and family; they were only trying to help. But I would hope the medical establishment would reflect on themselves and improve.

Oldham, MD, MS, one of psychiatry\'s most influential architects of personality disorder theory, traces his remarkable journey from frontier medicine roots in Oklahoma to revolutionizing how mental health professionals understand and diagnose personality pathology.\n\nTransforming diagnostic paradigms\n\nDr. Oldham\'s contributions have fundamentally reshaped personality disorder classification, moving the field from rigid diagnostic categories toward a more nuanced dimensional system. As former President of both the American Psychiatric Association and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, he and a team of colleagues spearheaded the development of the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), marking what many consider the most significant epistemological shift in psychiatric diagnosis for these conditions in decades.\n\n"The dimensional approach more accurately reflects the gradations and interplay of personality traits we see in clinical practice," Dr. Oldham explains in the interview. His innovative New Personality Self-Portrait online assessment tool (npsp25.com), based on a book continuously in print for 35 years, has provided both clinicians and the public with accessible ways to understand personality styles and potential pathology.\n\nFrom bedside to policy leadership\n\nDr. Oldham\'s career trajectory exemplifies the integration of clinical expertise with systems-level innovation. After training at Columbia, including psychoanalytic study under Otto Kernberg, he participated in the development of one of the first semi-structured clinical research interviews for DSM-III personality disorders, the Personality Disorders Examination (PDE). This groundbreaking work emerged during his tenure at Cornell, where he served as chief of an inpatient unit specializing in intensive treatment.\n\n"My training took place when the Vietnam War was winding down. I was fortunate to enroll in the Berry Plan, which allowed me to complete my specialty training before assuming active duty," Dr. Oldham reflects. His two years of military service as a Major in the US Air Force, including interviews with returning POWs who had endured solitary confinement for up to 7 years, provided early lessons in resilience and crisis response that would prove invaluable throughout his career.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond academic medicine when he accepted the role of Chief Medical Officer for the New York State Office of Mental Health, a position he held from 1988 to 2002. In this capacity, he served as the senior physician in a large public system that, when he first assumed the role, operated approximately 25,000 inpatient beds. He emphasized bridging the gap between the state hospital centers and academic education, fostering formal teaching partnerships between the hospitals and medical school psychiatry departments. . Following the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, Dr. Oldham helped navigate that unprecedented mental health crisis with what colleagues describe as exceptional clarity and resolve.\n\nAdvancing scientific understanding through collaboration\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Oldham has demonstrated how collaborative research can advance understanding of complex psychiatric conditions. As co-Principal Investigator of the New York site for the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS), he contributed to generating crucial findings about personality disorder trajectories over more than a decade. This ambitious NIMH-funded project represented one of the most comprehensive investigations into personality pathology ever undertaken.\n\nQuestions remain about how dimensional approaches to personality disorders will be implemented in routine clinical practice. How will training programs need to adapt to teach these new diagnostic frameworks? What implications does this shift have for treatment planning and insurance coverage? These considerations highlight ongoing challenges as the field transitions from traditional categorical thinking.\n\nEditorial excellence and mentorship\n\nCurrently serving as editor or co-editor for three major journals, Journal of Psychiatric Practice, Journal of Personality Disorders, and Borderline Personality Disorder and Emotion Dysregulation, Dr. Oldham continues to shape scientific discourse in the field. His editorial work emphasizes pragmatic, evidence-informed approaches to complex psychopathology while fostering the next generation of researchers and clinicians. "My family values have always made me conscientious and a good team player. The best leader is the leader who listens," Dr. Oldham shares, reflecting on the leadership principles that have guided his editorial work.\n\nThe interview reveals personal insights that illuminate Dr. Oldham\'s professional philosophy. His early life, in a family culture that emphasized concern and respect for others, profoundly influenced his approach to patient care, particularly his later focus on helping individuals with serious medical illnesses cope with psychological distress. This humanistic perspective permeates his scientific contributions, from developing assessment tools to advocating for improved treatment access.\n\nLegacy and future directions\n\nDr. Oldham\'s work raises intriguing questions about the future of psychiatric diagnosis. As genetic and neurobiological research advances, how will dimensional models of personality integrate with emerging biomarkers? What role will technology play in implementing these more sophisticated diagnostic approaches in clinical settings? His contributions provide a foundation for addressing these challenges while maintaining focus on improving patient outcomes.\n\nThe evolution from categorical to dimensional understanding of personality disorders represents more than a technical advancement, it reflects a fundamental shift in how psychiatry conceptualizes human psychological variation. This transformation promises more personalized treatment approaches but also demands new frameworks for clinical training and practice guidelines.\n\nDr. John M. Oldham\'s Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today\'s most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist\'s impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T06:55:00Z', 'url': 'https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250611/John-Oldham-redefines-the-landscape-of-personality-disorders.aspx'}

A study pinpoints the real reason why.", 'text': 'A recent study explored people\'s experiences of weight stigma before and after bariatric surgery, highlighting its potential impacts on mental and physical health.\n\nEven before kindergarten, Autumn Lloyd feared other kids wouldn\'t like her because she was twice their size.\n\nIn high school, she lost more than half her body weight through a punishing and unsustainable regimen of diet and exercise, which was celebrated by her peers and even featured in a local newspaper.\n\n"Even though I excelled academically, I feel like it never quite mattered as much as this vanity piece," Lloyd told Live Science.\n\nWhen the weight later returned, as research shows it often does, Lloyd felt scrutinized, which led to her obsessively monitoring her eating and exercise in public, while binge eating in private. A dietician suggested she track her food intake, but it became an obsession, and the pressure to lose weight contributed to self-injury and depression.\n\nBy college, she\'d been hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts, with her weight deeply tied to her mental health . She continued a grueling exercise regimen — even running the Chicago marathon twice — before reaching her lowest adult weight. Then the weight returned.\n\nAfter further weight gain, Lloyd underwent bariatric surgery in 2022, dropping a substantial amount of weight but less than the median. She felt judged by others. "If you appear to be obese, and didn\'t hit your weight goal, you look [to some] like a failure," she said.\n\nLloyd\'s experience of being scrutinized and negatively judged for her weight is not unique. The negative mental health consequences Lloyd faced are also not rare. A growing body of evidence suggests that weight stigma itself leads to poorer mental, physical and economic health for people with higher body weights.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Their study, which was published June 5 in the journal Health Psychology, found that shedding weight stigma — rather than the weight itself — may explain why some people report better mental health and less disordered eating after weight-loss surgery.\n\nOn the flip side, people who underwent weight-loss surgery but still faced stigma afterward were at higher risk for depression, anxiety and disordered eating compared to their less-stigmatized peers, the study found. These findings suggest that the stigma, not just body size, presents a major barrier to better health for those with obesity.\n\nRelated: Childhood obesity should be treated early and aggressively, new guidelines say. Is that safe?\n\nWhat is weight stigma?\n\nBias against people who are overweight often stems from the misconception that a person\'s body weight is entirely within their personal control and can be managed with diet and exercise alone. Research, however, shows that weight is shaped by a complex mix of genetic, physiological, psychological and social factors. Studies show that for most, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss long-term is very difficult without proper medical assistance.\n\nWeight stigma is pervasive, with over 40% of U.S. adults reporting that they\'ve experienced it personally at some point in their lives. Growing evidence shows that weight stigma does not help with weight loss , and what\'s more, it can worsen health . It\'s associated with increased stress, inflammation and mental health issues, including depression and disordered eating behaviors, according to the World Obesity Federation .\n\n"There\'s considerable evidence that societal weight stigma is prevalent and has harmful health consequences for people with obesity," said Rebecca Puhl , deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nHowever, there\'s little data about what happens to people after they lose weight through surgery — the most effective intervention for severe obesity and one that\'s become more common in recent years.\n\n"This new study begins to address this research gap," Puhl told Live Science.\n\nLosing weight doesn\'t make you "immune"\' to stigma\n\nPast research showed that while bariatric surgery improves mental health for most, some people see their mental health worsen afterward. Previous work has also hinted that weight stigma could play a role in the amount of weight lost or regained after surgery.\n\nTo understand the effect of weight stigma in this dynamic before and after weight-loss treatment, McGarrity and her colleagues recruited 148 patients who underwent bariatric surgery. They collected data before surgery and 1.5 to three years afterward, measuring patients\' experiences of weight stigma in the week prior to survey, alongside measures of their mental health and eating behaviors.\n\nBariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss. Larissa McGarrity, University of Utah Health\n\nMore than 90% of the patients reported experiencing stigma before the procedure, and most — about 60% — experienced significantly less weight stigma post-surgery.\n\nThose who experienced less stigma afterward saw notable improvements in mental and physical health. They were more likely to have a lower weight at that time point compared to patients who continued experiencing stigma post-surgery. However, weight loss itself was not associated with the improvement in mental health.\n\nRelated: Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among US teens\n\nAbout 40% of participants reported regularly experiencing weight stigma following their procedures, and these people were at increased risk for mental health problems compared to their peers. The higher the level of weight stigma reported post-operatively, the higher the risk for poor mental health, eating behavior and weight outcomes. Again, these effects appeared to be tied to the perception of stigma rather than to any weight loss they had after the surgery.\n\nThe study suggests "bariatric surgery patients are not immune to the effects of weight stigma, even years after surgery, even after significant amounts of weight loss," McGarrity said.\n\nShe emphasized that the study design has important limitations: the patients\' experience of weight stigma was self-reported, and for obvious ethical reasons, the study didn\'t assign people to face differing levels of weight stigma. As such, it cannot directly establish cause and effect. Moreover, the patients were drawn from only one region and their perceived stigma was only measured at one time point after surgery.\n\nPuhl added that it would also have been helpful to get a more detailed picture of the patient\'s experience over time. And more research is needed to understand how much this bias affected patient health.\n\nThe takeaways\n\nThe findings highlight how important it is to address weight stigma at every stage of a patient\'s weight journey, and not assume it will resolve after surgery, Puhl said.\n\nMcGarrity said public health and policy officials, as well as members of the media, should examine whether the public conversation around weight could be harming people\'s health. On an individual level, she said that everyone can "do better with the people in our lives who struggle with weight — to not just be one more person that conveys the [message of] \'just eat less and exercise more.\'"\n\nThat jives with Lloyd\'s experience. "If you\'re in a world where weight stigma is hitting you from every side, I think that will directly hinder your progress," Lloyd said.\n\nLloyd says she\'s learned to tackle the aspect of weight stigma she can control: her own perception of her weight. To people who live with a higher weight, she says to be kind to themselves.\n\n"The journey is very difficult. There\'s a lot of noise to filter through, and there\'s some fights that we just don\'t have the bandwidth to get into," Lloyd said. "You\'re not broken. You\'re not failing because you haven\'t reduced your weight."\n\nEditor\'s note: This story was updated on June 11, 2025, to adjust Autumn Huett\'s name to Llyod, her married name.

The article uncovers the indicators of this mental condition to help you with easy detection.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The Emotional Highs And Lows That Trigger Anxiety and Depression\n\nBipolar Disorder: The world has been constantly seeing a surge in mental health-related cases, the disorders that surround mental well-being don't get enough amount of attention due to the presence of silence that encompasses mental health-friendly conversations. Several conditions receive more lack of awareness than others, making them more neglected when a person suffers from them.\n\nWhat Is Bipolar Disorder?\n\nOne of such mental health conditions is Bipolar disorder, which was earlier called as manic depression. This type of mental health condition is the one that causes extreme mood swings. These changes in the mood can include emotional highs, which are also known as mania or hypomania, and emotional lows too which are termed as depression. Hypomania is less extreme than mania.\n\nWhen a person becomes depressed or sad, they may end up feeling sad or hopeless with reduced attraction towards things that intrigued them or that they once found interesting. But on the contrary, when a person's mood shifts to mania or hypomania, then they may feel enthusiastic, excited and euphoric. Making a person full of energy or unusually irritable.\n\nWhat Exactly Happens In Bipolar Disorder?\n\nThese certain shifts in moods can adversely affect a person's sleep, energy, various activities, judgment, and cognitive functioning of a person. The signs of Bipolar disorder, or the manic-depressive disorder, often go unrecognised due to the lack of awareness. This condition of the mind is marked by extreme fluctuations and disruptions in mood, energy, and activity levels.\n\nSymptoms of Bipolar Disorder\n\nThe symptoms can involve episodes where an individual may experience unparalleled elation, enthusiasm, and overactive involvement of the brain. The symptoms can also involve many depressive and despondent episodes, where one may see the dark sides of the condition, including sadness, hopelessness, and severe fatigue. Look for these symptoms given below to check if you are one of the people who could be suffering from such a mental disorder.\n\nMood Swings\n\nAny individual who faces bipolar disorder is bound to have over-the-top and elevated moods, which are marked by increased energy and reduced need for sleep, and are also accompanied by rapid thinking and speech.\n\nYou may like to read\n\nInstances of Depression\n\nPeople who have suffered through such mental conditions have complained about frequent disturbances that are made visible through forever residing sadness, loss of interest, loss of energy, and changes in several patterns and behaviours\n\nIncreased Flow of Energy\n\nPeople who suffer from this condition are known to have reported an increase in their energy levels. During such manic episodes, individuals may feel unusually energised and may feel that their brain is unusually active during such times. Such an increased flow of energy may feel euphoric.\n\nA Reduced Flow of Energy\n\nAn increase in energy is not the only indicator of bipolar disorder, but there are times when people also face a reduction in their energy levels. During such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals are bound to experience fatigue and a lack of motivation that may make them lose interest.\n\nDisruptions In Sleep Patterns\n\nThe people who have bipolar disorder have manic episodes that cause a reduction in the need for rest and are associated with reduced need for sleep. On the other hand, the dark- depressive episodes also involve insomnia that is marked by patterns of excessive sleeping, making the person sleep for longer hours.\n\nChanges In Appetite\n\nThe brain disorder can affect the intestine, causing an individual to eat too much or too less. Amendments in appetite, or eating patterns such as eating more or less than regular, are intensely linked with both manic and depressive episodes. This symptom can also cause other disorders.\n\nImpulsive Behaviour\n\nDuring such manic episodes of bipolar disorder, the people who go through them may exhibit impulsive and reckless behaviour, where they can become more aggressive and impatient of what happens around them. Making them more prone to negative emotions and feelings that can intensify the condition.\n\nDisconnect from the world\n\nDuring such dark and depressive episodes, a lot of individuals may also see themselves in a situation where they feel like withdrawing from social activities and work, as this condition can make them lose interest in the things and the hobbies that they enjoyed the most in the past.\n\nDifficulty In Focusing And Concentrating\n\nA lot of Individuals who go through these extreme highs and lows may end up experiencing difficulty in focusing and concentrating.

Ron DeSantis signed it into law on May 30, 2025. The same bill calls for high schools in six Florida districts to adopt the ban during the upcoming school year and produce a report on its effectiveness by Dec. 1, 2026.\n\nParents are divided on the issue. According to a report from Education Week, many parents want their kids to have phones for safety reasons – and don’t support bans as a result.\n\nBut in the debate over whether phones should be banned in K-12 schools – and if so, how – students themselves are rarely given a voice.\n\nWe are experts in media use and public health who surveyed 1,510 kids ages 11 to 13 in Florida in November and December 2024 to learn how they’re using digital media and the role tech plays in their lives at home and at school. Their responses were insightful – and occasionally surprising.\n\nAdults generally cite four reasons to ban phone use during school: to improve kids’ mental health, to strengthen academic outcomes, to reduce cyberbullying and to help limit kids’ overall screen time.\n\nBut as our survey shows, it may be a bit much to expect a cellphone ban to accomplish all of that.\n\nWhat do kids want?\n\nSome of the questions in our survey shine light on kids’ feelings toward banning cellphones – even though we didn’t ask that question directly.\n\nWe asked them if they feel relief when they’re in a situation where they can’t use their smartphone, and 31% said yes.\n\nAdditionally, 34% of kids agreed with the statement that social media causes more harm than good.\n\nAnd kids were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to agree with those statements if they attended schools where phones are banned or confiscated for most of the school day, with use only permitted at certain times. That group covered 70% of the students we surveyed because many individual schools or school districts in Florida have already limited students’ cellphone use.\n\nHow students use cellphones matters\n\nSome “power users” of cellphone apps could likely use a break from them.\n\nTwenty percent of children we surveyed said push notifications on their phones — that is, notifications from apps that pop up on the phone’s screen — are never turned off. These notifications are likely coming from the most popular apps kids reported using, like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.\n\nThis 20% of children was roughly three times more likely to report experiencing anxiety than kids who rarely or never have their notifications on.\n\nThey were also nearly five times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids whose notifications are always or sometimes off.\n\nOur survey results also suggest phone bans would likely have positive effects on grades and mental health among some of the heaviest screen users. For example, 22% of kids reported using their favorite app for six or more hours per day. These students were three times more likely to report earning mostly D’s and F’s in school than kids who spend an hour or less on their favorite app each day.\n\nThey also were six times more likely than hour-or-less users to report severe depression symptoms. These insights remained even after ruling out numerous other possible explanations for the difference — like age, household income, gender, parent’s education, race and ethnicity.\n\nBanning students’ access to phones at school means these kids would not receive notifications for at least that seven-hour period and have fewer hours in the day to use apps.\n\nPhones and mental health\n\nHowever, other data we collected suggests that bans aren’t a universal benefit for all children.\n\nSeventeen percent of kids who attend schools that ban or confiscate phones report severe depression symptoms, compared with just 4% among kids who keep their phones with them during the school day.\n\nThis finding held even after we ruled out other potential explanations for what we were seeing, such as the type of school students attend and other demographic factors.\n\nWe are not suggesting that our survey shows phone bans cause mental health problems.\n\nIt is possible, for instance, that the schools where kids already were struggling with their mental health simply happened to be the ones that have banned phones. Also, our survey didn’t ask kids how long phones have been banned at their schools. If the bans just launched, there may be positive effects on mental health or grades yet to come.\n\nIn order to get a better sense of the bans’ effects on mental health, we would need to examine mental health indicators before and after phone bans.\n\nTo get a long-term view on this question, we are planning to do a nationwide survey of digital media use and mental health, starting with 11- to 13-year-olds and tracking them into adulthood.\n\nEven with the limitations of our data from this survey, however, we can conclude that banning phones in schools is unlikely to be an immediate solution to mental health problems of kids ages 11-13.\n\nGrades up, cyberbullying down\n\nStudents at schools where phones are barred or confiscated didn’t report earning higher grades than children at schools where kids keep their phones.\n\nThis finding held for students at both private and public schools, and even after ruling out other possible explanations like differences in gender and household income, since these factors are also known to affect grades.\n\nThere are limits to our findings here: Grades are not a perfect measure of learning, and they’re not standardized across schools. It’s possible that kids at phone-free schools are in fact learning more than those at schools where kids carry their phones around during school hours – even if they earn the same grades.\n\nWe asked kids how often in the past three months they’d experienced mistreatment online – like being called hurtful names or having lies or rumors spread about them. Kids at schools where phone use is limited during school hours actually reported enduring more cyberbullying than children at schools with less restrictive policies. This result persisted even after we considered smartphone ownership and numerous demographics as possible explanations.\n\nWe are not necessarily saying that cellphone bans cause an increase in cyberbullying. What could be at play here is that at schools where cyberbullying has been particularly bad, phones have been banned or are confiscated, and online bullying still occurs.\n\nBut based on our survey results, it does not appear that school phone bans prevent cyberbullying.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that banning phones in schools may not be an easy fix for students’ mental health problems, poor academic performance or cyberbullying.\n\nThat said, kids might benefit from phone-free schools in ways that we have not explored, like increased attention spans or reduced eyestrain.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:00:00Z', 'url': 'https://theconversation.com/we-surveyed-1-500-florida-kids-about-cellphones-and-their-mental-health-what-we-learned-suggests-school-phone-bans-may-have-important-but-limited-effects-256970'}
