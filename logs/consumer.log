Title: I'm 18 years old, born in a turkish-muslim family and live in Germany. I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.

Life is worthless in this case, if you can call it life. Glad one day I'll disappear of this hell.

Hopefully, next life will be with nice people around.

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, even though I want to so bad. I bought a big bottle of NyQuil, I thought I had the balls to take the entire thing but I gagged and almost vomited when I only took the recommended dose. I hate reality, I hate being alive but my survival instincts kick in last minute preventing me from giving myself and the people around me relief. I need encouragement to help kill myself please I don't want to wake up tomorrow.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: Pretty much what the title says. She just threw a tantrum, hit me and yelled at me to hang myself. 

She said the same thing earlier when she came back from work as well.

I'm failing at life really bad. I'm too fucked up in the head to get a job, dropped out of uni a few days ago because I couldn't handle it anymore.

I know I'm a parasite and she has all the rights to hate me, but I'm trying to get better despite everything.

I started therapy last week, the issue is that she's paying for it and just threatened to stop giving me money.

I started going outside more, started to exercise at home so I stop being weak and pathetic. It helps a little bit, but it's not enough.

I feel so unfit for life. People younger than me are so much more mature. I'm basically stuck in the same mentality I had when I was 9. 

I don't want to die, I'm scared to die, but with each passing year everything is getting worse, I lose motivation and energy and hope, and it's getting to the point where this is the only reasonable choice I have left.

Sorry for writing all this and for any mistakes that might be there. English is not my first language and I'm writing this while crying at 4am. I just needed to get this off my chest. I don't really have anyone else to talk to.

I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: Pretty much what the title says. She just threw a tantrum, hit me and yelled at me to hang myself. 

She said the same thing earlier when she came back from work as well.

I'm failing at life really bad. I'm too fucked up in the head to get a job, dropped out of uni a few days ago because I couldn't handle it anymore.

I know I'm a parasite and she has all the rights to hate me, but I'm trying to get better despite everything.

I started therapy last week, the issue is that she's paying for it and just threatened to stop giving me money.

I started going outside more, started to exercise at home so I stop being weak and pathetic. It helps a little bit, but it's not enough.

I feel so unfit for life. People younger than me are so much more mature. I'm basically stuck in the same mentality I had when I was 9. 

I don't want to die, I'm scared to die, but with each passing year everything is getting worse, I lose motivation and energy and hope, and it's getting to the point where this is the only reasonable choice I have left.

Title: After 7 years of carrying around trauma around my best friends death. Of panic attacks and so flashbacks and so much more. I finally reached out for help. 

Except I had the session today and I was so open with her, I was just ready to have help. I told her I wanna get to the root cause of what‚Äôs causing this anxiety and deep dive, I‚Äôm tired of just coping skills.

Proceeds to tell me ‚Äúwell when you get anxious just tell yourself STOP and don‚Äôt be anxious anymore. We can‚Äôt control if people die.‚Äù 

Then proceeds ‚Äúyour friend is heaven, she‚Äôs fine, don‚Äôt be anxious about your other friends, by the way do you love your male friend seems intense feelings?‚Äù (I‚Äôm a Christian but lady and NO it‚Äôs platonic) proceeds to press if I love him 

Like regretting even asking for help‚Ä¶

Title: I'm 18 years old, born in a turkish-muslim family and live in Germany. I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.

Life is worthless in this case, if you can call it life. Glad one day I'll disappear of this hell.

Hopefully, next life will be with nice people around.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner.

Title: I'm 18 years old, born in a turkish-muslim family and live in Germany. I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.

Life is worthless in this case, if you can call it life. Glad one day I'll disappear of this hell.

Hopefully, next life will be with nice people around.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

I bought a big bottle of NyQuil, I thought I had the balls to take the entire thing but I gagged and almost vomited when I only took the recommended dose. I hate reality, I hate being alive but my survival instincts kick in last minute preventing me from giving myself and the people around me relief. I need encouragement to help kill myself please I don't want to wake up tomorrow.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: Pretty much what the title says. She just threw a tantrum, hit me and yelled at me to hang myself. 

She said the same thing earlier when she came back from work as well.

I'm failing at life really bad. I'm too fucked up in the head to get a job, dropped out of uni a few days ago because I couldn't handle it anymore.

I know I'm a parasite and she has all the rights to hate me, but I'm trying to get better despite everything.

I started therapy last week, the issue is that she's paying for it and just threatened to stop giving me money.

I started going outside more, started to exercise at home so I stop being weak and pathetic. It helps a little bit, but it's not enough.

I feel so unfit for life. People younger than me are so much more mature. I'm basically stuck in the same mentality I had when I was 9. 

I don't want to die, I'm scared to die, but with each passing year everything is getting worse, I lose motivation and energy and hope, and it's getting to the point where this is the only reasonable choice I have left.

Sorry for writing all this and for any mistakes that might be there. English is not my first language and I'm writing this while crying at 4am. I just needed to get this off my chest. I don't really have anyone else to talk to.

Title: After 7 years of carrying around trauma around my best friends death. Of panic attacks and so flashbacks and so much more. I finally reached out for help. 

Except I had the session today and I was so open with her, I was just ready to have help. I told her I wanna get to the root cause of what‚Äôs causing this anxiety and deep dive, I‚Äôm tired of just coping skills.

Proceeds to tell me ‚Äúwell when you get anxious just tell yourself STOP and don‚Äôt be anxious anymore. We can‚Äôt control if people die.‚Äù 

Then proceeds ‚Äúyour friend is heaven, she‚Äôs fine, don‚Äôt be anxious about your other friends, by the way do you love your male friend seems intense feelings?‚Äù (I‚Äôm a Christian but lady and NO it‚Äôs platonic) proceeds to press if I love him 

Like regretting even asking for help‚Ä¶

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: Pretty much what the title says. She just threw a tantrum, hit me and yelled at me to hang myself. 

She said the same thing earlier when she came back from work as well.

I'm failing at life really bad. I'm too fucked up in the head to get a job, dropped out of uni a few days ago because I couldn't handle it anymore.

I know I'm a parasite and she has all the rights to hate me, but I'm trying to get better despite everything.

I started therapy last week, the issue is that she's paying for it and just threatened to stop giving me money.

I started going outside more, started to exercise at home so I stop being weak and pathetic. It helps a little bit, but it's not enough.

I feel so unfit for life. People younger than me are so much more mature. I'm basically stuck in the same mentality I had when I was 9. 

I don't want to die, I'm scared to die, but with each passing year everything is getting worse, I lose motivation and energy and hope, and it's getting to the point where this is the only reasonable choice I have left.

Sorry for writing all this and for any mistakes that might be there. English is not my first language and I'm writing this while crying at 4am. I just needed to get this off my chest. I don't really have anyone else to talk to.

Title: I'm 18 years old, born in a turkish-muslim family and live in Germany. I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.

Life is worthless in this case, if you can call it life. Glad one day I'll disappear of this hell.

Hopefully, next life will be with nice people around.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: I'm 18 years old, born in a turkish-muslim family and live in Germany. I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.

Life is worthless in this case, if you can call it life. Glad one day I'll disappear of this hell.

Hopefully, next life will be with nice people around.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: You might have saw my last post. I'm headed back to LA today to be with family. I wish there was good news. I just ache more and more. I find out more information every day. His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: Pretty much what the title says. She just threw a tantrum, hit me and yelled at me to hang myself. 

She said the same thing earlier when she came back from work as well.

I'm failing at life really bad. I'm too fucked up in the head to get a job, dropped out of uni a few days ago because I couldn't handle it anymore.

I know I'm a parasite and she has all the rights to hate me, but I'm trying to get better despite everything.

I started therapy last week, the issue is that she's paying for it and just threatened to stop giving me money.

I started going outside more, started to exercise at home so I stop being weak and pathetic. It helps a little bit, but it's not enough.

I feel so unfit for life. People younger than me are so much more mature. I'm basically stuck in the same mentality I had when I was 9. 

I don't want to die, I'm scared to die, but with each passing year everything is getting worse, I lose motivation and energy and hope, and it's getting to the point where this is the only reasonable choice I have left.

Sorry for writing all this and for any mistakes that might be there. English is not my first language and I'm writing this while crying at 4am. I just needed to get this off my chest. I don't really have anyone else to talk to.

I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: Pretty much what the title says. She just threw a tantrum, hit me and yelled at me to hang myself. 

She said the same thing earlier when she came back from work as well.

I'm failing at life really bad. I'm too fucked up in the head to get a job, dropped out of uni a few days ago because I couldn't handle it anymore.

I know I'm a parasite and she has all the rights to hate me, but I'm trying to get better despite everything.

I started therapy last week, the issue is that she's paying for it and just threatened to stop giving me money.

I started going outside more, started to exercise at home so I stop being weak and pathetic. It helps a little bit, but it's not enough.

I feel so unfit for life. People younger than me are so much more mature. I'm basically stuck in the same mentality I had when I was 9. 

I don't want to die, I'm scared to die, but with each passing year everything is getting worse, I lose motivation and energy and hope, and it's getting to the point where this is the only reasonable choice I have left.

Sorry for writing all this and for any mistakes that might be there. English is not my first language and I'm writing this while crying at 4am. I just needed to get this off my chest. I don't really have anyone else to talk to.

Title: I'm 18 years old, born in a turkish-muslim family and live in Germany. I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.

Life is worthless in this case, if you can call it life. Glad one day I'll disappear of this hell.

Hopefully, next life will be with nice people around.

Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point.

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: I'm 18 years old, born in a turkish-muslim family and live in Germany. I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.

Life is worthless in this case, if you can call it life. Glad one day I'll disappear of this hell.

Hopefully, next life will be with nice people around.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.

Life is worthless in this case, if you can call it life. Glad one day I'll disappear of this hell.

Hopefully, next life will be with nice people around.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: You might have saw my last post. I'm headed back to LA today to be with family. I wish there was good news. I just ache more and more. I find out more information every day. His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, even though I want to so bad. I bought a big bottle of NyQuil, I thought I had the balls to take the entire thing but I gagged and almost vomited when I only took the recommended dose. I hate reality, I hate being alive but my survival instincts kick in last minute preventing me from giving myself and the people around me relief. I need encouragement to help kill myself please I don't want to wake up tomorrow.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: I'm 18 years old, born in a turkish-muslim family and live in Germany. I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: I'm 18 years old, born in a turkish-muslim family and live in Germany. I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.

Life is worthless in this case, if you can call it life. Glad one day I'll disappear of this hell.

Hopefully, next life will be with nice people around.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Im not seeking anything, just making my post. Thanks for listening.

It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: You might have saw my last post. I'm headed back to LA today to be with family. I wish there was good news. I just ache more and more. I find out more information every day. His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect.

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Im not seeking anything, just making my post. Thanks for listening.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: TRIGGER WARNING

I fucking hate myself. I hate my life. I fucking neglected my gecko and she died tonight. It's my fucking fault she's dead. It's my fucking fault. I should've rehomed her. I should've gotten off my fat ass and fed and watered her more. I should've paid more attention. I should've realized sooner. I was too busy escaping my shitty life with a stupid fucking video game. 

My life is nothing. I'm 25 and I've never had a job. I'm too fucking scared to drive a car. I can't afford anything. I use my dad's stupid credit card (with permission, never without). I'm too fucking lazy to do the dishes or other chores. I haven't done laundry in months. I've been getting more and more depressed and nearly took my life twice this last month. 

I'll never forgive myself for killing my gecko. I deserve all the fucking hatred that comes my way. I deserve all of it. I don‚Äôt deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. 

I just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. 

I have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. 

I always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting. Just like she did. 

I achieve more in video games than I ever will in real life: working jobs, helping people, having cars and a home, having a social life, driving, overcoming fears.

Title: I, 19F, was diagnosed with Level 2 ASD. I've always shown signs, however, nobody ever picked them up because they were too busy about my grades. I have a job, I work 6 days a week, and I do well in it. My issue is that I cannot fucking take care of myself. Brushing my hair? A nightmare. Showering? I hate being wet and the feeling, it's an overload. Brushing my teeth? If I'm lucky, once in the morning a couple times a week. Better then before Ig. I can't cut my nails, I hate it, being shaven is also a nightmare in feeling. I can't make food, it's too overwhelming to do with chronic pain in my leg.
I'm about to cost my family thousands in dental work because I can't deal with it myself, and I'm spending thousands myself trying to find a cure or relief to my chronic pain. I require several medications that i cant take without freaking out, and I never sleep throughout the night due to violent nightmares. 
The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is my dreams. I don't want to become another statistic, another version of proof that autism makes people useless. I have dreams. I want my PhD, I know exactly what I want to study and that I'm good at it. I want a family and a wife and children and cats. But I know none of it will happen. I'm impossible to love. I'm a mess and disgusting and it's all falling apart. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on. Definitely not long enough for any of those to ever happen. I've already started to write my notes, in perfect grammar. Just like everyone's always known me for.

It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I, 19F, was diagnosed with Level 2 ASD. I've always shown signs, however, nobody ever picked them up because they were too busy about my grades. I have a job, I work 6 days a week, and I do well in it. My issue is that I cannot fucking take care of myself. Brushing my hair? A nightmare. Showering? I hate being wet and the feeling, it's an overload. Brushing my teeth? If I'm lucky, once in the morning a couple times a week. Better then before Ig. I can't cut my nails, I hate it, being shaven is also a nightmare in feeling. I can't make food, it's too overwhelming to do with chronic pain in my leg.
I'm about to cost my family thousands in dental work because I can't deal with it myself, and I'm spending thousands myself trying to find a cure or relief to my chronic pain. I require several medications that i cant take without freaking out, and I never sleep throughout the night due to violent nightmares. 
The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is my dreams. I don't want to become another statistic, another version of proof that autism makes people useless. I have dreams. I want my PhD, I know exactly what I want to study and that I'm good at it. I want a family and a wife and children and cats. But I know none of it will happen. I'm impossible to love. I'm a mess and disgusting and it's all falling apart. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on. Definitely not long enough for any of those to ever happen. I've already started to write my notes, in perfect grammar. Just like everyone's always known me for.

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Im not seeking anything, just making my post. Thanks for listening.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I, 19F, was diagnosed with Level 2 ASD. I've always shown signs, however, nobody ever picked them up because they were too busy about my grades. I have a job, I work 6 days a week, and I do well in it. My issue is that I cannot fucking take care of myself. Brushing my hair? A nightmare. Showering? I hate being wet and the feeling, it's an overload. Brushing my teeth? If I'm lucky, once in the morning a couple times a week. Better then before Ig. I can't cut my nails, I hate it, being shaven is also a nightmare in feeling. I can't make food, it's too overwhelming to do with chronic pain in my leg.
I'm about to cost my family thousands in dental work because I can't deal with it myself, and I'm spending thousands myself trying to find a cure or relief to my chronic pain. I require several medications that i cant take without freaking out, and I never sleep throughout the night due to violent nightmares. 
The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is my dreams. I don't want to become another statistic, another version of proof that autism makes people useless. I have dreams. I want my PhD, I know exactly what I want to study and that I'm good at it. I want a family and a wife and children and cats. But I know none of it will happen. I'm impossible to love. I'm a mess and disgusting and it's all falling apart. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on. Definitely not long enough for any of those to ever happen. I've already started to write my notes, in perfect grammar. Just like everyone's always known me for.

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left.

Title: As the title says I'm gonna end myself soon. I don't care anymore, I'm just so down I can't see a dim of light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm just gonna find a rope and hung myself, I belive it's an easy and quick way. 

I have a big debt because of gambling, I gained weight, mental health deteriorated so bad for the past 2 years and I lost every single bit of confidence I had ( I had little before) 
No girlfriend, no supportive parents relatives or friends. I'm just gonna do it and fuck it, in the end, it takes courage to do something like this, right?

And yes I did seek help with my addiction, I have relapsed many times but this time is different, I have lost everything and don't plan on continuing the same circle. I'm just gonna admit it that I'm a failure and in my 24 years of living I have lived and tried enough. 

I'm writing this just because I need to ditch and maybe they will find this post after I've done it 
I'm not going to leave a note anywhere else.

Good luck to everyone and don't gamble and be as stupid as me.
Wish you guys the best !

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I, 19F, was diagnosed with Level 2 ASD. I've always shown signs, however, nobody ever picked them up because they were too busy about my grades. I have a job, I work 6 days a week, and I do well in it. My issue is that I cannot fucking take care of myself. Brushing my hair? A nightmare. Showering? I hate being wet and the feeling, it's an overload. Brushing my teeth? If I'm lucky, once in the morning a couple times a week. Better then before Ig. I can't cut my nails, I hate it, being shaven is also a nightmare in feeling. I can't make food, it's too overwhelming to do with chronic pain in my leg.
I'm about to cost my family thousands in dental work because I can't deal with it myself, and I'm spending thousands myself trying to find a cure or relief to my chronic pain. I require several medications that i cant take without freaking out, and I never sleep throughout the night due to violent nightmares. 
The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is my dreams. I don't want to become another statistic, another version of proof that autism makes people useless. I have dreams. I want my PhD, I know exactly what I want to study and that I'm good at it. I want a family and a wife and children and cats. But I know none of it will happen. I'm impossible to love. I'm a mess and disgusting and it's all falling apart. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on. Definitely not long enough for any of those to ever happen. I've already started to write my notes, in perfect grammar. Just like everyone's always known me for.

Title: As the title says I'm gonna end myself soon. I don't care anymore, I'm just so down I can't see a dim of light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm just gonna find a rope and hung myself, I belive it's an easy and quick way. 

I have a big debt because of gambling, I gained weight, mental health deteriorated so bad for the past 2 years and I lost every single bit of confidence I had ( I had little before) 
No girlfriend, no supportive parents relatives or friends. I'm just gonna do it and fuck it, in the end, it takes courage to do something like this, right?

And yes I did seek help with my addiction, I have relapsed many times but this time is different, I have lost everything and don't plan on continuing the same circle. I'm just gonna admit it that I'm a failure and in my 24 years of living I have lived and tried enough. 

I'm writing this just because I need to ditch and maybe they will find this post after I've done it 
I'm not going to leave a note anywhere else.

Good luck to everyone and don't gamble and be as stupid as me.
Wish you guys the best !

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: About a year ago I came to the realization that I must kill myself because I find it very challenging to adapt and fit into society. I feel an urgent need to hang myself. I believe that delaying it will only make things more mentally difficult further down the line. 

I have extreme anxiety and panic, along with chronic depression and I have difficulty keeping a long-term job. I will likely struggle financially when I move out, so I automatically feel compelled to hang myself. 

I have been passively suicidal every single day for over a year. I have tried to rethink my decision, but I find it very hard because the thought of hanging myself feels like my most mentally relieving option.

So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: You might have saw my last post. I'm headed back to LA today to be with family. I wish there was good news. I just ache more and more. I find out more information every day. His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: About a year ago I came to the realization that I must kill myself because I find it very challenging to adapt and fit into society. I feel an urgent need to hang myself. I believe that delaying it will only make things more mentally difficult further down the line. 

I have extreme anxiety and panic, along with chronic depression and I have difficulty keeping a long-term job. I will likely struggle financially when I move out, so I automatically feel compelled to hang myself. 

I have been passively suicidal every single day for over a year. I have tried to rethink my decision, but I find it very hard because the thought of hanging myself feels like my most mentally relieving option.

Title: I, 19F, was diagnosed with Level 2 ASD. I've always shown signs, however, nobody ever picked them up because they were too busy about my grades. I have a job, I work 6 days a week, and I do well in it. My issue is that I cannot fucking take care of myself. Brushing my hair? A nightmare. Showering? I hate being wet and the feeling, it's an overload. Brushing my teeth? If I'm lucky, once in the morning a couple times a week. Better then before Ig. I can't cut my nails, I hate it, being shaven is also a nightmare in feeling. I can't make food, it's too overwhelming to do with chronic pain in my leg.
I'm about to cost my family thousands in dental work because I can't deal with it myself, and I'm spending thousands myself trying to find a cure or relief to my chronic pain. I require several medications that i cant take without freaking out, and I never sleep throughout the night due to violent nightmares. 
The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is my dreams. I don't want to become another statistic, another version of proof that autism makes people useless. I have dreams. I want my PhD, I know exactly what I want to study and that I'm good at it. I want a family and a wife and children and cats. But I know none of it will happen. I'm impossible to love. I'm a mess and disgusting and it's all falling apart. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on. Definitely not long enough for any of those to ever happen. I've already started to write my notes, in perfect grammar. Just like everyone's always known me for.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness.

Title: As the title says I'm gonna end myself soon. I don't care anymore, I'm just so down I can't see a dim of light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm just gonna find a rope and hung myself, I belive it's an easy and quick way. 

I have a big debt because of gambling, I gained weight, mental health deteriorated so bad for the past 2 years and I lost every single bit of confidence I had ( I had little before) 
No girlfriend, no supportive parents relatives or friends. I'm just gonna do it and fuck it, in the end, it takes courage to do something like this, right?

And yes I did seek help with my addiction, I have relapsed many times but this time is different, I have lost everything and don't plan on continuing the same circle. I'm just gonna admit it that I'm a failure and in my 24 years of living I have lived and tried enough. 

I'm writing this just because I need to ditch and maybe they will find this post after I've done it 
I'm not going to leave a note anywhere else.

Good luck to everyone and don't gamble and be as stupid as me.
Wish you guys the best !

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Im not seeking anything, just making my post. Thanks for listening.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: You might have saw my last post. I'm headed back to LA today to be with family. I wish there was good news. I just ache more and more. I find out more information every day. His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: About a year ago I came to the realization that I must kill myself because I find it very challenging to adapt and fit into society. I feel an urgent need to hang myself. I believe that delaying it will only make things more mentally difficult further down the line. 

I have extreme anxiety and panic, along with chronic depression and I have difficulty keeping a long-term job. I will likely struggle financially when I move out, so I automatically feel compelled to hang myself. 

I have been passively suicidal every single day for over a year. I have tried to rethink my decision, but I find it very hard because the thought of hanging myself feels like my most mentally relieving option.

Title: As the title says I'm gonna end myself soon. I don't care anymore, I'm just so down I can't see a dim of light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm just gonna find a rope and hung myself, I belive it's an easy and quick way. 

I have a big debt because of gambling, I gained weight, mental health deteriorated so bad for the past 2 years and I lost every single bit of confidence I had ( I had little before) 
No girlfriend, no supportive parents relatives or friends. I'm just gonna do it and fuck it, in the end, it takes courage to do something like this, right?

And yes I did seek help with my addiction, I have relapsed many times but this time is different, I have lost everything and don't plan on continuing the same circle. I'm just gonna admit it that I'm a failure and in my 24 years of living I have lived and tried enough. 

I'm writing this just because I need to ditch and maybe they will find this post after I've done it 
I'm not going to leave a note anywhere else.

Good luck to everyone and don't gamble and be as stupid as me.
Wish you guys the best !

Title: Hey everybody. 
This is my first ever post on Reddit.
English is not even my first language, so Im sorry for the typos and shit.

So where do I begin..Im F 23.
I am a bad person.
I am a nobody , liar, a bad person. I have anger issues.
Im mean. 
Im antisocial, introvert,weird, highschool dropout.
I have NOTHING going on in my life except Im in a relationship for like 9 years now. 
He is the best person ever I don‚Äôt even know why is he with me still.
I had a horrible childhood, like many of us do.
Alcoholic abusive drug addict dad and a mom who was-is probalby mentally ill too.
Since I was 0 years old I was abused mentally and physically too. And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.
In elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn‚Äôt had control of.
In highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.
Since then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..
I had some friends maybe like 3..
I wasn‚Äôt introverted.
Now look at me.
I don‚Äôt even go out of the fucking house anymore.
Wherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn‚Äôt tbh.
I get it. Im a shit show.
 And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.
My depression took my life away literally.
I have zero friends zero social life zero nothing üòÇ
And Its all my fault.
Bc Im not capable. 
I am a waste of a human.
It got to a point where I really wanna end it. 
I just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.
So Im here for now.
Im self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don‚Äôt believe in it. I think for me there is no help.
So now that you read all this you can judge me too. I know you will.  Maybe nobody will ever read this. I don‚Äôt even know what to call this? Venting? A call for help? Probably not.
I am a fucking horrible person and I deserve every fucking bit of this life. 

The worst part? I hate my dad. But when I think about him, that he is alone, drinking his life away I feel sorry for him, and me. Bc I see him in me. Im sorry for what he went through his childhood. He could had us. But he choose alcohol despite the promises. Now he is alone, Im alone. So congrats dad you made it. 
You created this hell for us. U and me are the same. We are both alone even tho we could have done better. We wouldn‚Äôt . And maybe that‚Äôs for the better.  We are both horrible. I am my fathers daughter.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: I, 19F, was diagnosed with Level 2 ASD. I've always shown signs, however, nobody ever picked them up because they were too busy about my grades. I have a job, I work 6 days a week, and I do well in it. My issue is that I cannot fucking take care of myself. Brushing my hair? A nightmare. Showering? I hate being wet and the feeling, it's an overload. Brushing my teeth? If I'm lucky, once in the morning a couple times a week. Better then before Ig. I can't cut my nails, I hate it, being shaven is also a nightmare in feeling. I can't make food, it's too overwhelming to do with chronic pain in my leg.
I'm about to cost my family thousands in dental work because I can't deal with it myself, and I'm spending thousands myself trying to find a cure or relief to my chronic pain. I require several medications that i cant take without freaking out, and I never sleep throughout the night due to violent nightmares. 
The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is my dreams. I don't want to become another statistic, another version of proof that autism makes people useless. I have dreams. I want my PhD, I know exactly what I want to study and that I'm good at it. I want a family and a wife and children and cats. But I know none of it will happen. I'm impossible to love. I'm a mess and disgusting and it's all falling apart. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on. Definitely not long enough for any of those to ever happen. I've already started to write my notes, in perfect grammar. Just like everyone's always known me for.

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Im not seeking anything, just making my post. Thanks for listening.

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: You might have saw my last post. I'm headed back to LA today to be with family. I wish there was good news. I just ache more and more. I find out more information every day. His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: About a year ago I came to the realization that I must kill myself because I find it very challenging to adapt and fit into society. I feel an urgent need to hang myself. I believe that delaying it will only make things more mentally difficult further down the line. 

I have extreme anxiety and panic, along with chronic depression and I have difficulty keeping a long-term job. I will likely struggle financially when I move out, so I automatically feel compelled to hang myself. 

I have been passively suicidal every single day for over a year. I have tried to rethink my decision, but I find it very hard because the thought of hanging myself feels like my most mentally relieving option.

Title: Hey everybody. 
This is my first ever post on Reddit.
English is not even my first language, so Im sorry for the typos and shit.

So where do I begin..Im F 23.
I am a bad person.
I am a nobody , liar, a bad person. I have anger issues.
Im mean. 
Im antisocial, introvert,weird, highschool dropout.
I have NOTHING going on in my life except Im in a relationship for like 9 years now. 
He is the best person ever I don‚Äôt even know why is he with me still.
I had a horrible childhood, like many of us do.
Alcoholic abusive drug addict dad and a mom who was-is probalby mentally ill too.
Since I was 0 years old I was abused mentally and physically too. And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.
In elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn‚Äôt had control of.
In highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.
Since then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..
I had some friends maybe like 3..
I wasn‚Äôt introverted.
Now look at me.
I don‚Äôt even go out of the fucking house anymore.
Wherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn‚Äôt tbh.
I get it. Im a shit show.
 And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.
My depression took my life away literally.
I have zero friends zero social life zero nothing üòÇ
And Its all my fault.
Bc Im not capable. 
I am a waste of a human.
It got to a point where I really wanna end it. 
I just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.
So Im here for now.
Im self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don‚Äôt believe in it. I think for me there is no help.
So now that you read all this you can judge me too. I know you will.  Maybe nobody will ever read this. I don‚Äôt even know what to call this? Venting? A call for help? Probably not.
I am a fucking horrible person and I deserve every fucking bit of this life. 

The worst part? I hate my dad. But when I think about him, that he is alone, drinking his life away I feel sorry for him, and me. Bc I see him in me. Im sorry for what he went through his childhood. He could had us. But he choose alcohol despite the promises. Now he is alone, Im alone. So congrats dad you made it. 
You created this hell for us. U and me are the same. We are both alone even tho we could have done better. We wouldn‚Äôt . And maybe that‚Äôs for the better.  We are both horrible. I am my fathers daughter.

Title: I, 19F, was diagnosed with Level 2 ASD. I've always shown signs, however, nobody ever picked them up because they were too busy about my grades. I have a job, I work 6 days a week, and I do well in it. My issue is that I cannot fucking take care of myself. Brushing my hair? A nightmare. Showering? I hate being wet and the feeling, it's an overload. Brushing my teeth? If I'm lucky, once in the morning a couple times a week. Better then before Ig. I can't cut my nails, I hate it, being shaven is also a nightmare in feeling. I can't make food, it's too overwhelming to do with chronic pain in my leg.
I'm about to cost my family thousands in dental work because I can't deal with it myself, and I'm spending thousands myself trying to find a cure or relief to my chronic pain. I require several medications that i cant take without freaking out, and I never sleep throughout the night due to violent nightmares. 
The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is my dreams. I don't want to become another statistic, another version of proof that autism makes people useless. I have dreams. I want my PhD, I know exactly what I want to study and that I'm good at it. I want a family and a wife and children and cats. But I know none of it will happen. I'm impossible to love. I'm a mess and disgusting and it's all falling apart. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on. Definitely not long enough for any of those to ever happen. I've already started to write my notes, in perfect grammar. Just like everyone's always known me for.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Im not seeking anything, just making my post. Thanks for listening.

I have extreme anxiety and panic, along with chronic depression and I have difficulty keeping a long-term job. I will likely struggle financially when I move out, so I automatically feel compelled to hang myself.

Title: Hey everybody. 
This is my first ever post on Reddit.
English is not even my first language, so Im sorry for the typos and shit.

So where do I begin..Im F 23.
I am a bad person.
I am a nobody , liar, a bad person. I have anger issues.
Im mean. 
Im antisocial, introvert,weird, highschool dropout.
I have NOTHING going on in my life except Im in a relationship for like 9 years now. 
He is the best person ever I don‚Äôt even know why is he with me still.
I had a horrible childhood, like many of us do.
Alcoholic abusive drug addict dad and a mom who was-is probalby mentally ill too.
Since I was 0 years old I was abused mentally and physically too. And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.
In elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn‚Äôt had control of.
In highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.
Since then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..
I had some friends maybe like 3..
I wasn‚Äôt introverted.
Now look at me.
I don‚Äôt even go out of the fucking house anymore.
Wherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn‚Äôt tbh.
I get it. Im a shit show.
 And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.
My depression took my life away literally.
I have zero friends zero social life zero nothing üòÇ
And Its all my fault.
Bc Im not capable. 
I am a waste of a human.
It got to a point where I really wanna end it. 
I just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.
So Im here for now.
Im self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don‚Äôt believe in it. I think for me there is no help.
So now that you read all this you can judge me too. I know you will.  Maybe nobody will ever read this. I don‚Äôt even know what to call this? Venting? A call for help? Probably not.
I am a fucking horrible person and I deserve every fucking bit of this life. 

The worst part? I hate my dad. But when I think about him, that he is alone, drinking his life away I feel sorry for him, and me. Bc I see him in me. Im sorry for what he went through his childhood. He could had us. But he choose alcohol despite the promises. Now he is alone, Im alone. So congrats dad you made it. 
You created this hell for us. U and me are the same. We are both alone even tho we could have done better. We wouldn‚Äôt . And maybe that‚Äôs for the better.  We are both horrible. I am my fathers daughter.

Title: It‚Äôs literally the only goal/ dreamI have in my life. People say that people who commit suicide are selfish, but no, the people who say that are the selfish ones for letting these people suffer knowing fully that they can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt get better. 

Im 24 years old and i‚Äôve wanted this daily, hourly and every minute since I was 12. There‚Äôs no point of suffering. I have no friends and I don‚Äôt want to make any because friendships, hobbies, and anything people may do to pass time, are solely pass-time activities that are done to escape life for a while. The more efficient option to pass time is to die and I get sick thinking of how hard it is for me to do that.

I was hospitalised twice for attempting suicide and I would still do it again knowing it would work. I‚Äôve been put on all kinds of medication and nothing will ever put me at peace other than suicide. I‚Äôve always come back to this sub because reading about people who have a similar mindset helps mildly with my mood. So now, im making my own post.

Im not seeking anything, just making my post. Thanks for listening.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: You might have saw my last post. I'm headed back to LA today to be with family. I wish there was good news. I just ache more and more. I find out more information every day. His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I, 19F, was diagnosed with Level 2 ASD. I've always shown signs, however, nobody ever picked them up because they were too busy about my grades. I have a job, I work 6 days a week, and I do well in it. My issue is that I cannot fucking take care of myself. Brushing my hair? A nightmare. Showering? I hate being wet and the feeling, it's an overload. Brushing my teeth? If I'm lucky, once in the morning a couple times a week. Better then before Ig. I can't cut my nails, I hate it, being shaven is also a nightmare in feeling. I can't make food, it's too overwhelming to do with chronic pain in my leg.
I'm about to cost my family thousands in dental work because I can't deal with it myself, and I'm spending thousands myself trying to find a cure or relief to my chronic pain. I require several medications that i cant take without freaking out, and I never sleep throughout the night due to violent nightmares. 
The only thing keeping me from killing myself right now is my dreams. I don't want to become another statistic, another version of proof that autism makes people useless. I have dreams. I want my PhD, I know exactly what I want to study and that I'm good at it. I want a family and a wife and children and cats. But I know none of it will happen. I'm impossible to love. I'm a mess and disgusting and it's all falling apart. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going on. Definitely not long enough for any of those to ever happen. I've already started to write my notes, in perfect grammar. Just like everyone's always known me for.

Title: I'm a 22 year old male, my ex-girlfriend is 26. The story of our relationship is long and very complicated but the tldr is: we met, "fell in love" and broke up all during an year while living together as roommates.
It was a very rough year for both of us, I lost my father and she was dealing with her very abusive family while graduating law school and trying to manage her borderline personality disorder.
We were living in a house with 6 people in total, it was an environment littered with alcohol, drugs and parties (Those were some of the reasons why I chose to live in that house originally, although that was before my father died). I was never a heavy drinker and I'm still not (but I wanted to be for some reason) she is a self proclaimed alcoholic.
So obviously most of the sex we had was while we were drunk and she was the one that almost always started it. 
Wich was great for me at the time because I was madly in love and she only knew how to express what she felt after getting hammered. I had just lost my father, who was the only family I ever had, so I took whatever form of "love" I could find as a blessing and I lacked the self respect to stop myself from engaging. A lot of the times I was sexually harassed into starting intercourse. Especially after realizing how toxic it was that even though I expressed clearly that I didn't want to have sex she would lock the door to the room and not let me leave until I slept with her (for example). meanwhile I was externality pleating to leave because that relationship was hurting me, but internally I was pleating to myself to give in and receive affection. 
Well... That couldn't have lasted long because I just broke at the start of this year. We had spent some time apart and the first day we saw each other after I came back from winter brake she approached me completely drunk in the middle of a party at our house and started kissing me all over without even saying a word. She was stinking of booze and I just couldn't handle it anymore, I had a panic attack and left the party, a friend came after me and helped calm me down.
while venting to my friend I told her the story of my relationship with my ex and she told me I had been raped and sexuality assaulted by my ex multiple times based on the things I told her.
Initially I resisted the idea but she convinced me arguing "what if the roles where reversed" (there was a specific instance where my ex didn't allow me to leave her room, she locked the door, threw me in the bed and held me down until I relented Wich lasted for more than an hour, I eventually did, but I don't remember the sex that followed) 
Well what my friend told me I couldn't look at her the same way anymore, I felt violeted and in the next morning I spoke with her (my ex) and told her that I believed she had raped me. She argued back and I agreed eventually with her, that men can't be raped by women, she then said that I actually raped her a long time ago when she was not awake one morning of September last year, but she didn't say anything because she didn't care. 
I have no recollection of this event we rarely had sex in the morning and I fell completely horrified with myself, I don't deserve to live. How could I do this to a sleeping person and not even remember it??? What type of sick fuck am I???

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: About a year ago I came to the realization that I must kill myself because I find it very challenging to adapt and fit into society. I feel an urgent need to hang myself. I believe that delaying it will only make things more mentally difficult further down the line. 

I have extreme anxiety and panic, along with chronic depression and I have difficulty keeping a long-term job. I will likely struggle financially when I move out, so I automatically feel compelled to hang myself. 

I have been passively suicidal every single day for over a year. I have tried to rethink my decision, but I find it very hard because the thought of hanging myself feels like my most mentally relieving option.

Title: Hey everybody. 
This is my first ever post on Reddit.
English is not even my first language, so Im sorry for the typos and shit.

So where do I begin..Im F 23.
I am a bad person.
I am a nobody , liar, a bad person. I have anger issues.
Im mean. 
Im antisocial, introvert,weird, highschool dropout.
I have NOTHING going on in my life except Im in a relationship for like 9 years now. 
He is the best person ever I don‚Äôt even know why is he with me still.
I had a horrible childhood, like many of us do.
Alcoholic abusive drug addict dad and a mom who was-is probalby mentally ill too.
Since I was 0 years old I was abused mentally and physically too. And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.
In elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn‚Äôt had control of.
In highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.
Since then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..
I had some friends maybe like 3..
I wasn‚Äôt introverted.
Now look at me.
I don‚Äôt even go out of the fucking house anymore.
Wherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn‚Äôt tbh.
I get it. Im a shit show.
 And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.
My depression took my life away literally.
I have zero friends zero social life zero nothing üòÇ
And Its all my fault.
Bc Im not capable. 
I am a waste of a human.
It got to a point where I really wanna end it. 
I just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.
So Im here for now.
Im self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don‚Äôt believe in it. I think for me there is no help.
So now that you read all this you can judge me too. I know you will.  Maybe nobody will ever read this. I don‚Äôt even know what to call this? Venting? A call for help? Probably not.
I am a fucking horrible person and I deserve every fucking bit of this life. 

The worst part? I hate my dad. But when I think about him, that he is alone, drinking his life away I feel sorry for him, and me. Bc I see him in me. Im sorry for what he went through his childhood. He could had us. But he choose alcohol despite the promises. Now he is alone, Im alone. So congrats dad you made it. 
You created this hell for us. U and me are the same. We are both alone even tho we could have done better. We wouldn‚Äôt . And maybe that‚Äôs for the better.  We are both horrible. I am my fathers daughter.

Title: I'm a 22 year old male, my ex-girlfriend is 26. The story of our relationship is long and very complicated but the tldr is: we met, "fell in love" and broke up all during an year while living together as roommates.
It was a very rough year for both of us, I lost my father and she was dealing with her very abusive family while graduating law school and trying to manage her borderline personality disorder.
We were living in a house with 6 people in total, it was an environment littered with alcohol, drugs and parties (Those were some of the reasons why I chose to live in that house originally, although that was before my father died). I was never a heavy drinker and I'm still not (but I wanted to be for some reason) she is a self proclaimed alcoholic.
So obviously most of the sex we had was while we were drunk and she was the one that almost always started it. 
Wich was great for me at the time because I was madly in love and she only knew how to express what she felt after getting hammered. I had just lost my father, who was the only family I ever had, so I took whatever form of "love" I could find as a blessing and I lacked the self respect to stop myself from engaging. A lot of the times I was sexually harassed into starting intercourse. Especially after realizing how toxic it was that even though I expressed clearly that I didn't want to have sex she would lock the door to the room and not let me leave until I slept with her (for example). meanwhile I was externality pleating to leave because that relationship was hurting me, but internally I was pleating to myself to give in and receive affection. 
Well... That couldn't have lasted long because I just broke at the start of this year. We had spent some time apart and the first day we saw each other after I came back from winter brake she approached me completely drunk in the middle of a party at our house and started kissing me all over without even saying a word. She was stinking of booze and I just couldn't handle it anymore, I had a panic attack and left the party, a friend came after me and helped calm me down.
while venting to my friend I told her the story of my relationship with my ex and she told me I had been raped and sexuality assaulted by my ex multiple times based on the things I told her.

I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: I'm a 22 year old male, my ex-girlfriend is 26. The story of our relationship is long and very complicated but the tldr is: we met, "fell in love" and broke up all during an year while living together as roommates.
It was a very rough year for both of us, I lost my father and she was dealing with her very abusive family while graduating law school and trying to manage her borderline personality disorder.
We were living in a house with 6 people in total, it was an environment littered with alcohol, drugs and parties (Those were some of the reasons why I chose to live in that house originally, although that was before my father died). I was never a heavy drinker and I'm still not (but I wanted to be for some reason) she is a self proclaimed alcoholic.
So obviously most of the sex we had was while we were drunk and she was the one that almost always started it. 
Wich was great for me at the time because I was madly in love and she only knew how to express what she felt after getting hammered. I had just lost my father, who was the only family I ever had, so I took whatever form of "love" I could find as a blessing and I lacked the self respect to stop myself from engaging. A lot of the times I was sexually harassed into starting intercourse. Especially after realizing how toxic it was that even though I expressed clearly that I didn't want to have sex she would lock the door to the room and not let me leave until I slept with her (for example). meanwhile I was externality pleating to leave because that relationship was hurting me, but internally I was pleating to myself to give in and receive affection. 
Well... That couldn't have lasted long because I just broke at the start of this year. We had spent some time apart and the first day we saw each other after I came back from winter brake she approached me completely drunk in the middle of a party at our house and started kissing me all over without even saying a word. She was stinking of booze and I just couldn't handle it anymore, I had a panic attack and left the party, a friend came after me and helped calm me down.
while venting to my friend I told her the story of my relationship with my ex and she told me I had been raped and sexuality assaulted by my ex multiple times based on the things I told her.
Initially I resisted the idea but she convinced me arguing "what if the roles where reversed" (there was a specific instance where my ex didn't allow me to leave her room, she locked the door, threw me in the bed and held me down until I relented Wich lasted for more than an hour, I eventually did, but I don't remember the sex that followed) 
Well what my friend told me I couldn't look at her the same way anymore, I felt violeted and in the next morning I spoke with her (my ex) and told her that I believed she had raped me. She argued back and I agreed eventually with her, that men can't be raped by women, she then said that I actually raped her a long time ago when she was not awake one morning of September last year, but she didn't say anything because she didn't care. 
I have no recollection of this event we rarely had sex in the morning and I fell completely horrified with myself, I don't deserve to live. How could I do this to a sleeping person and not even remember it??? What type of sick fuck am I???

Title: About a year ago I came to the realization that I must kill myself because I find it very challenging to adapt and fit into society. I feel an urgent need to hang myself. I believe that delaying it will only make things more mentally difficult further down the line. 

I have extreme anxiety and panic, along with chronic depression and I have difficulty keeping a long-term job. I will likely struggle financially when I move out, so I automatically feel compelled to hang myself. 

I have been passively suicidal every single day for over a year. I have tried to rethink my decision, but I find it very hard because the thought of hanging myself feels like my most mentally relieving option.

Title: Hey everybody. 
This is my first ever post on Reddit.
English is not even my first language, so Im sorry for the typos and shit.

So where do I begin..Im F 23.
I am a bad person.
I am a nobody , liar, a bad person. I have anger issues.
Im mean. 
Im antisocial, introvert,weird, highschool dropout.
I have NOTHING going on in my life except Im in a relationship for like 9 years now. 
He is the best person ever I don‚Äôt even know why is he with me still.
I had a horrible childhood, like many of us do.
Alcoholic abusive drug addict dad and a mom who was-is probalby mentally ill too.
Since I was 0 years old I was abused mentally and physically too. And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.
In elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn‚Äôt had control of.
In highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.
Since then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..
I had some friends maybe like 3..
I wasn‚Äôt introverted.
Now look at me.
I don‚Äôt even go out of the fucking house anymore.
Wherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn‚Äôt tbh.
I get it. Im a shit show.
 And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.
My depression took my life away literally.
I have zero friends zero social life zero nothing üòÇ
And Its all my fault.
Bc Im not capable. 
I am a waste of a human.
It got to a point where I really wanna end it. 
I just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.
So Im here for now.
Im self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don‚Äôt believe in it. I think for me there is no help.
So now that you read all this you can judge me too. I know you will.  Maybe nobody will ever read this. I don‚Äôt even know what to call this? Venting? A call for help? Probably not.
I am a fucking horrible person and I deserve every fucking bit of this life. 

The worst part? I hate my dad. But when I think about him, that he is alone, drinking his life away I feel sorry for him, and me. Bc I see him in me. Im sorry for what he went through his childhood. He could had us. But he choose alcohol despite the promises. Now he is alone, Im alone. So congrats dad you made it. 
You created this hell for us. U and me are the same. We are both alone even tho we could have done better. We wouldn‚Äôt . And maybe that‚Äôs for the better.  We are both horrible. I am my fathers daughter.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: Book talks about how addictive behaviors (like constantly checking phones, drinking coffee, having to always snack) can prevent the body from resting, and this can lead to diseases like cancer. Highly recommend!

Title: I'm a 22 year old male, my ex-girlfriend is 26. The story of our relationship is long and very complicated but the tldr is: we met, "fell in love" and broke up all during an year while living together as roommates.
It was a very rough year for both of us, I lost my father and she was dealing with her very abusive family while graduating law school and trying to manage her borderline personality disorder.
We were living in a house with 6 people in total, it was an environment littered with alcohol, drugs and parties (Those were some of the reasons why I chose to live in that house originally, although that was before my father died). I was never a heavy drinker and I'm still not (but I wanted to be for some reason) she is a self proclaimed alcoholic.
So obviously most of the sex we had was while we were drunk and she was the one that almost always started it. 
Wich was great for me at the time because I was madly in love and she only knew how to express what she felt after getting hammered. I had just lost my father, who was the only family I ever had, so I took whatever form of "love" I could find as a blessing and I lacked the self respect to stop myself from engaging. A lot of the times I was sexually harassed into starting intercourse. Especially after realizing how toxic it was that even though I expressed clearly that I didn't want to have sex she would lock the door to the room and not let me leave until I slept with her (for example). meanwhile I was externality pleating to leave because that relationship was hurting me, but internally I was pleating to myself to give in and receive affection. 
Well... That couldn't have lasted long because I just broke at the start of this year. We had spent some time apart and the first day we saw each other after I came back from winter brake she approached me completely drunk in the middle of a party at our house and started kissing me all over without even saying a word. She was stinking of booze and I just couldn't handle it anymore, I had a panic attack and left the party, a friend came after me and helped calm me down.
while venting to my friend I told her the story of my relationship with my ex and she told me I had been raped and sexuality assaulted by my ex multiple times based on the things I told her.
Initially I resisted the idea but she convinced me arguing "what if the roles where reversed" (there was a specific instance where my ex didn't allow me to leave her room, she locked the door, threw me in the bed and held me down until I relented Wich lasted for more than an hour, I eventually did, but I don't remember the sex that followed) 
Well what my friend told me I couldn't look at her the same way anymore, I felt violeted and in the next morning I spoke with her (my ex) and told her that I believed she had raped me. She argued back and I agreed eventually with her, that men can't be raped by women, she then said that I actually raped her a long time ago when she was not awake one morning of September last year, but she didn't say anything because she didn't care. 
I have no recollection of this event we rarely had sex in the morning and I fell completely horrified with myself, I don't deserve to live. How could I do this to a sleeping person and not even remember it??? What type of sick fuck am I???

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: About a year ago I came to the realization that I must kill myself because I find it very challenging to adapt and fit into society. I feel an urgent need to hang myself. I believe that delaying it will only make things more mentally difficult further down the line. 

I have extreme anxiety and panic, along with chronic depression and I have difficulty keeping a long-term job. I will likely struggle financially when I move out, so I automatically feel compelled to hang myself. 

I have been passively suicidal every single day for over a year. I have tried to rethink my decision, but I find it very hard because the thought of hanging myself feels like my most mentally relieving option.

Title: Hey everybody. 
This is my first ever post on Reddit.
English is not even my first language, so Im sorry for the typos and shit.

So where do I begin..Im F 23.
I am a bad person.
I am a nobody , liar, a bad person. I have anger issues.
Im mean. 
Im antisocial, introvert,weird, highschool dropout.
I have NOTHING going on in my life except Im in a relationship for like 9 years now. 
He is the best person ever I don‚Äôt even know why is he with me still.
I had a horrible childhood, like many of us do.
Alcoholic abusive drug addict dad and a mom who was-is probalby mentally ill too.
Since I was 0 years old I was abused mentally and physically too. And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.
In elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn‚Äôt had control of.
In highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.
Since then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..
I had some friends maybe like 3..
I wasn‚Äôt introverted.
Now look at me.
I don‚Äôt even go out of the fucking house anymore.
Wherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn‚Äôt tbh.
I get it. Im a shit show.
 And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.
My depression took my life away literally.
I have zero friends zero social life zero nothing üòÇ
And Its all my fault.
Bc Im not capable. 
I am a waste of a human.
It got to a point where I really wanna end it. 
I just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.
So Im here for now.
Im self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don‚Äôt believe in it. I think for me there is no help.
So now that you read all this you can judge me too. I know you will.  Maybe nobody will ever read this. I don‚Äôt even know what to call this? Venting? A call for help? Probably not.
I am a fucking horrible person and I deserve every fucking bit of this life. 

The worst part? I hate my dad. But when I think about him, that he is alone, drinking his life away I feel sorry for him, and me. Bc I see him in me. Im sorry for what he went through his childhood. He could had us. But he choose alcohol despite the promises. Now he is alone, Im alone. So congrats dad you made it. 
You created this hell for us. U and me are the same. We are both alone even tho we could have done better. We wouldn‚Äôt . And maybe that‚Äôs for the better.  We are both horrible. I am my fathers daughter.

Title: I'm gonna try to make this sound as non edgy as possible, but I feel like I've never properly enjoyed being alive. When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: I'm a 22 year old male, my ex-girlfriend is 26. The story of our relationship is long and very complicated but the tldr is: we met, "fell in love" and broke up all during an year while living together as roommates.
It was a very rough year for both of us, I lost my father and she was dealing with her very abusive family while graduating law school and trying to manage her borderline personality disorder.
We were living in a house with 6 people in total, it was an environment littered with alcohol, drugs and parties (Those were some of the reasons why I chose to live in that house originally, although that was before my father died). I was never a heavy drinker and I'm still not (but I wanted to be for some reason) she is a self proclaimed alcoholic.
So obviously most of the sex we had was while we were drunk and she was the one that almost always started it. 
Wich was great for me at the time because I was madly in love and she only knew how to express what she felt after getting hammered. I had just lost my father, who was the only family I ever had, so I took whatever form of "love" I could find as a blessing and I lacked the self respect to stop myself from engaging. A lot of the times I was sexually harassed into starting intercourse. Especially after realizing how toxic it was that even though I expressed clearly that I didn't want to have sex she would lock the door to the room and not let me leave until I slept with her (for example). meanwhile I was externality pleating to leave because that relationship was hurting me, but internally I was pleating to myself to give in and receive affection. 
Well... That couldn't have lasted long because I just broke at the start of this year. We had spent some time apart and the first day we saw each other after I came back from winter brake she approached me completely drunk in the middle of a party at our house and started kissing me all over without even saying a word. She was stinking of booze and I just couldn't handle it anymore, I had a panic attack and left the party, a friend came after me and helped calm me down.
while venting to my friend I told her the story of my relationship with my ex and she told me I had been raped and sexuality assaulted by my ex multiple times based on the things I told her.
Initially I resisted the idea but she convinced me arguing "what if the roles where reversed" (there was a specific instance where my ex didn't allow me to leave her room, she locked the door, threw me in the bed and held me down until I relented Wich lasted for more than an hour, I eventually did, but I don't remember the sex that followed) 
Well what my friend told me I couldn't look at her the same way anymore, I felt violeted and in the next morning I spoke with her (my ex) and told her that I believed she had raped me. She argued back and I agreed eventually with her, that men can't be raped by women, she then said that I actually raped her a long time ago when she was not awake one morning of September last year, but she didn't say anything because she didn't care. 
I have no recollection of this event we rarely had sex in the morning and I fell completely horrified with myself, I don't deserve to live. How could I do this to a sleeping person and not even remember it??? What type of sick fuck am I???

Title: I‚Äôm gonna turn 19 next month. I‚Äôm straight, single and a virgin. Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I‚Äôm honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over‚Ä¶ my penis size. I‚Äôve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I‚Äôm erect. It‚Äôs around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small? Can it still grow? What if I can‚Äôt satisfy my future partner? What if this ruins my chances at a happy relationship or marriage?

It just feels like I‚Äôm jumping from one insecurity to another. I don‚Äôt know why this keeps happening, but it‚Äôs eating me up inside. I just want to feel okay about myself for once.

Title: Hey everybody. 
This is my first ever post on Reddit.
English is not even my first language, so Im sorry for the typos and shit.

So where do I begin..Im F 23.
I am a bad person.
I am a nobody , liar, a bad person. I have anger issues.
Im mean. 
Im antisocial, introvert,weird, highschool dropout.
I have NOTHING going on in my life except Im in a relationship for like 9 years now. 
He is the best person ever I don‚Äôt even know why is he with me still.
I had a horrible childhood, like many of us do.
Alcoholic abusive drug addict dad and a mom who was-is probalby mentally ill too.
Since I was 0 years old I was abused mentally and physically too. And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.
In elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn‚Äôt had control of.
In highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.
Since then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..
I had some friends maybe like 3..
I wasn‚Äôt introverted.
Now look at me.
I don‚Äôt even go out of the fucking house anymore.
Wherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn‚Äôt tbh.
I get it. Im a shit show.
 And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.
My depression took my life away literally.
I have zero friends zero social life zero nothing üòÇ
And Its all my fault.
Bc Im not capable. 
I am a waste of a human.
It got to a point where I really wanna end it. 
I just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.
So Im here for now.
Im self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don‚Äôt believe in it. I think for me there is no help.
So now that you read all this you can judge me too. I know you will.  Maybe nobody will ever read this. I don‚Äôt even know what to call this? Venting? A call for help? Probably not.
I am a fucking horrible person and I deserve every fucking bit of this life. 

The worst part? I hate my dad. But when I think about him, that he is alone, drinking his life away I feel sorry for him, and me. Bc I see him in me. Im sorry for what he went through his childhood. He could had us. But he choose alcohol despite the promises. Now he is alone, Im alone. So congrats dad you made it. 
You created this hell for us. U and me are the same. We are both alone even tho we could have done better. We wouldn‚Äôt . And maybe that‚Äôs for the better.  We are both horrible. I am my fathers daughter.

Title: About a year ago I came to the realization that I must kill myself because I find it very challenging to adapt and fit into society. I feel an urgent need to hang myself. I believe that delaying it will only make things more mentally difficult further down the line. 

I have extreme anxiety and panic, along with chronic depression and I have difficulty keeping a long-term job. I will likely struggle financially when I move out, so I automatically feel compelled to hang myself. 

I have been passively suicidal every single day for over a year. I have tried to rethink my decision, but I find it very hard because the thought of hanging myself feels like my most mentally relieving option.

Title: I am passively suicidal every day and it‚Äôs extremely draining. 

I genuinely want to die but I‚Äôm too scared of going through with it. My survival instincts keep me from acting on my thoughts. It makes it very unlikely that I will become actively suicidal which only worsened my feelings of hopelessness. 

I keep telling myself, "this time you will go through with it," but I never do and the cycle continues.

Title: I've been through it all: SSRI's, panic attacks, uncontrolled shaking, throat tightness, chest pain, weight loss - and then weight gain - and then weight loss, probably some alcoholism, benzodiazepines, trying out every 'stress relief' strategy under the sun, etc.

Anxiety has permeated my life for over 2 years and has been a cloud on my family and I. And I FINALLY see the light at the end of the tunnel.

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

**It gets better folks**. Even when you're in the thick of it, and you think 'this is just me now' - I promise - so many things can change and you will take that deep fulfilling breath again one day. So many people told me this and I didnt believe them, but from someone who has gone through it: It gets better. Keep striving and believing.

Title: You might have saw my last post. I'm headed back to LA today to be with family. I wish there was good news. I just ache more and more. I find out more information every day. His gun always had a full chamber as it was meant for emergencys. Though from what the police had said, when he shot himself the gun only had three rounds. I've been in fear, maybe even a sense of sorrow. I talked to my therapist over the phone. The best guess is it was for me, our cat and him. I'm doing nothing but wanting him to have shot me too. I want nothing more to have joined him. I go back to get my stuff today and from what it says on life360, his phone is there. Would looking through it make things harder? Maybe I'd figure out why he did this. Maybe it give me a reason to finally take my self out for good. His moms blaming me for killing him. Saying I drove him to this point. Honestly I don't know if she's right. My fiance told me he never wanted me back with my parents, he wanted me with him and only him. He'd kill himself if I left. Leaving this town seems like it'll kill me too. But I have nothing left here expect the memory of the love of my life.

Title: Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve noticed something that‚Äôs starting to bother me a bit. I masturbate almost every night, and it‚Äôs become such a routine that I can‚Äôt really fall asleep unless I do it.

It started because it helped me relax and fall asleep faster, especially at night when my mind would be busy. But now it feels like I‚Äôve trained my body to rely on it, and on the nights I skip it, I just lie there awake for ages.

Important note: I don‚Äôt use p*rn at all. It‚Äôs just imagination, but still, the habit feels kind of locked in.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm addicted exactly, but I don‚Äôt like the idea that I can‚Äôt sleep naturally without it anymore.

Who else deals with this? Or has any advice?
