I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality.

I deserve all of it. I don’t deserve the love and respect people give me, even if I've done great things and go out of my way to help others. I fucking killed an innocent animal and I'm a monster. I deserve jail. I deserve to die a slow and painful death like my gecko did. \n\nI just stopped fucking caring. I've stopped caring for myself. I've stopped caring for her. I stopped caring to do chores. I've stopped caring about everything but escaping with a stupid fucking video game. I don't deserve empathy. I don't deserve kindness. I want to fucking kill myself and get the pain over with. \n\nI have never amounted to anything. I never will. I have nothing to lose if I die. All I do is virtually escape and mooch off of others. I'm scared of dying, but I just want to put a gun to my head and never look back. I'm a waste of a life. I don't want kindness. I want to scream into the void. I wish I was a good person. I try so hard to be. \n\nI always strive to help others. I always strive to never hurt anyone. I can't be a criminal in a video game without becoming depressed. But I fucked up and slowly killed an innocent being. I don't take pleasure from her passing. I don't take pleasure in her suffering. I'm miserable. I'm hurting.

I was circumcised without my consent at the age of 9. I didn't even know what they would do to me. After the surgery, I woke up with horrible pain in my genitals. I looked at it, it was wrapped in a bandage and completely covered in blood. Couldn't even walk because of the pain. I took the bandage off in the toilet and saw my penis completely destroyed, covered in blood and stitched up. Peeing was so FUCKING painful for weeks, the worst pain ever. I couldn't cry or show any emotion, I was just in shock. At 15, I started to realize everything what i was missing, what they had taken from me. I completly raged and began to suffer from extreme PTSD. I remember everything, every FUCKING day, every morning, every night. Waking up from nightmares, screaming, scratching my face, punching my head, realizing this isn't just a nightmare, but reality. I've been locked up in psychiatric hospitals five times, only to be released after a few days and weeks. They couldn't help me, and I guess there's nothing to do in this case. People with penises are worthless here, their genitals are legally mutilated, and nobody cares. I feel it, this heavy tightness in my heart, being stabbed a billion times over and over and over, dying inside every fucking day, living in constant torture, knowing that the most beautiful, sensitive, pleasurable part of my body has been ripped out and cut to pieces. Being this intimate with someone you love, feeling all that pleasure together, is what they took away from me. Sex isn't satisfying for me. I love being with this person, but I just feel numb down there, difficult holding erections due to lack of sensation and emotional stress. FUCK THESE BASTARDS who have nothing better to do than mutilating children. Three years have passed, desperately waiting for regenerative solutions (like foregen) while the rest of this painful life slips by. Every day, my heart breaks into a thousand pieces, knowing others are going through the same shit, and society doesn't give a damn about.\n\nLife is worthless in this case, if you can call it life.

I have anger issues.\nIm mean. \nIm antisocial, introvert,weird, highschool dropout.\nI have NOTHING going on in my life except Im in a relationship for like 9 years now. \nHe is the best person ever I don’t even know why is he with me still.\nI had a horrible childhood, like many of us do.\nAlcoholic abusive drug addict dad and a mom who was-is probalby mentally ill too.\nSince I was 0 years old I was abused mentally and physically too. And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.\nIn elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn’t had control of.\nIn highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.\nSince then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..\nI had some friends maybe like 3..\nI wasn’t introverted.\nNow look at me.\nI don’t even go out of the fucking house anymore.\nWherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn’t tbh.\nI get it. Im a shit show.\n And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.\nMy depression took my life away literally.\nI have zero friends zero social life zero nothing 😂\nAnd Its all my fault.\nBc Im not capable. \nI am a waste of a human.\nIt got to a point where I really wanna end it. \nI just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.\nSo Im here for now.\nIm self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don’t believe in it. I think for me there is no help.\nSo now that you read all this you can judge me too. I know you will.  Maybe nobody will ever read this. I don’t even know what to call this? Venting? A call for help? Probably not.\nI am a fucking horrible person and I deserve every fucking bit of this life. \n\nThe worst part? I hate my dad. But when I think about him, that he is alone, drinking his life away I feel sorry for him, and me. Bc I see him in me. Im sorry for what he went through his childhood. He could had us. But he choose alcohol despite the promises. Now he is alone, Im alone. So congrats dad you made it. \nYou created this hell for us. U and me are the same. We are both alone even tho we could have done better. We wouldn’t . And maybe that’s for the better.  We are both horrible.

And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.\nIn elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn’t had control of.\nIn highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.\nSince then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..\nI had some friends maybe like 3..\nI wasn’t introverted.\nNow look at me.\nI don’t even go out of the fucking house anymore.\nWherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn’t tbh.\nI get it. Im a shit show.\n And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.\nMy depression took my life away literally.\nI have zero friends zero social life zero nothing 😂\nAnd Its all my fault.\nBc Im not capable. \nI am a waste of a human.\nIt got to a point where I really wanna end it. \nI just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.\nSo Im here for now.\nIm self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don’t believe in it.

I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole.

The story of our relationship is long and very complicated but the tldr is: we met, "fell in love" and broke up all during an year while living together as roommates.\nIt was a very rough year for both of us, I lost my father and she was dealing with her very abusive family while graduating law school and trying to manage her borderline personality disorder.\nWe were living in a house with 6 people in total, it was an environment littered with alcohol, drugs and parties (Those were some of the reasons why I chose to live in that house originally, although that was before my father died). I was never a heavy drinker and I\'m still not (but I wanted to be for some reason) she is a self proclaimed alcoholic.\nSo obviously most of the sex we had was while we were drunk and she was the one that almost always started it. \nWich was great for me at the time because I was madly in love and she only knew how to express what she felt after getting hammered. I had just lost my father, who was the only family I ever had, so I took whatever form of "love" I could find as a blessing and I lacked the self respect to stop myself from engaging. A lot of the times I was sexually harassed into starting intercourse. Especially after realizing how toxic it was that even though I expressed clearly that I didn\'t want to have sex she would lock the door to the room and not let me leave until I slept with her (for example). meanwhile I was externality pleating to leave because that relationship was hurting me, but internally I was pleating to myself to give in and receive affection. \nWell... That couldn\'t have lasted long because I just broke at the start of this year. We had spent some time apart and the first day we saw each other after I came back from winter brake she approached me completely drunk in the middle of a party at our house and started kissing me all over without even saying a word. She was stinking of booze and I just couldn\'t handle it anymore, I had a panic attack and left the party, a friend came after me and helped calm me down.\nwhile venting to my friend I told her the story of my relationship with my ex and she told me I had been raped and sexuality assaulted by my ex multiple times based on the things I told her.\nInitially I resisted the idea but she convinced me arguing "what if the roles where reversed" (there was a specific instance where my ex didn\'t allow me to leave her room, she locked the door, threw me in the bed and held me down until I relented Wich lasted for more than an hour, I eventually did, but I don\'t remember the sex that followed) \nWell what my friend told me I couldn\'t look at her the same way anymore, I felt violeted and in the next morning I spoke with her (my ex) and told her that I believed she had raped me. She argued back and I agreed eventually with her, that men can\'t be raped by women, she then said that I actually raped her a long time ago when she was not awake one morning of September last year, but she didn\'t say anything because she didn\'t care. \nI have no recollection of this event we rarely had sex in the morning and I fell completely horrified with myself, I don\'t deserve to live.

The story of our relationship is long and very complicated but the tldr is: we met, "fell in love" and broke up all during an year while living together as roommates.\nIt was a very rough year for both of us, I lost my father and she was dealing with her very abusive family while graduating law school and trying to manage her borderline personality disorder.\nWe were living in a house with 6 people in total, it was an environment littered with alcohol, drugs and parties (Those were some of the reasons why I chose to live in that house originally, although that was before my father died). I was never a heavy drinker and I\'m still not (but I wanted to be for some reason) she is a self proclaimed alcoholic.\nSo obviously most of the sex we had was while we were drunk and she was the one that almost always started it. \nWich was great for me at the time because I was madly in love and she only knew how to express what she felt after getting hammered. I had just lost my father, who was the only family I ever had, so I took whatever form of "love" I could find as a blessing and I lacked the self respect to stop myself from engaging. A lot of the times I was sexually harassed into starting intercourse. Especially after realizing how toxic it was that even though I expressed clearly that I didn\'t want to have sex she would lock the door to the room and not let me leave until I slept with her (for example). meanwhile I was externality pleating to leave because that relationship was hurting me, but internally I was pleating to myself to give in and receive affection. \nWell... That couldn\'t have lasted long because I just broke at the start of this year. We had spent some time apart and the first day we saw each other after I came back from winter brake she approached me completely drunk in the middle of a party at our house and started kissing me all over without even saying a word. She was stinking of booze and I just couldn\'t handle it anymore, I had a panic attack and left the party, a friend came after me and helped calm me down.\nwhile venting to my friend I told her the story of my relationship with my ex and she told me I had been raped and sexuality assaulted by my ex multiple times based on the things I told her.\nInitially I resisted the idea but she convinced me arguing "what if the roles where reversed" (there was a specific instance where my ex didn\'t allow me to leave her room, she locked the door, threw me in the bed and held me down until I relented Wich lasted for more than an hour, I eventually did, but I don\'t remember the sex that followed) \nWell what my friend told me I couldn\'t look at her the same way anymore, I felt violeted and in the next morning I spoke with her (my ex) and told her that I believed she had raped me. She argued back and I agreed eventually with her, that men can\'t be raped by women, she then said that I actually raped her a long time ago when she was not awake one morning of September last year, but she didn\'t say anything because she didn\'t care. \nI have no recollection of this event we rarely had sex in the morning and I fell completely horrified with myself, I don\'t deserve to live.

Our lives and our issues are *complex*. I dunno about you, but I\'m always having a series of personal crises that nobody has any idea how to relate to or deal with, and it\'s a real fucking struggle between shit like financial anxiety, a physically dangerous living situation, a variety of serious health issues, et cetera.\n\nI was watching a video where someone talked about their experience with self-worth and CPTSD a while back, and they talked about how, if you have CPTSD and you feel like you need more help than other people, it\'s because *you probably do* \\-- and you probably have fewer resources than other people to get that help. And you know what? They were fuckin\' right.\n\nI don\'t have extended family, or immediate family. I don\'t really have friends, because I live in a car dependent area and need to make some serious health improvements before I can actually learn to drive, so leaving the house is actually really expensive or time-consuming (uber is expensive, and the bus system is a 2 hour ride to get somewhere that\'s 20 minutes away by car). \n\nBut then, while I have people to talk to online, *what the fuck do I have to talk about?* Everything going on in my life right now is a dumb waiting game. I\'m waiting to see how the CPAP impacts my ability to function, because that takes up to 8 weeks. I\'m waiting 2.5 weeks to increase the dose of a new medication, and it\'ll be 7 more weeks until we know how well *that* works. I\'m waiting another week to talk to my PCP\'s PA about a beta blocker. I\'ve gotta schedule an appointment with a surgeon to talk about my hernia. I see a trauma therapist twice a week. My "personal project" right now is just *working on my own health and recovery.* \n\nAnd I am constantly having some kind of stupid fucking crisis. Right now, pick a thing: \n\n* I\'m triggered because I am constantly anhedonic, and struggle with focusing, and the medication for that requires 7 more weeks of waiting just to see if it works. And I (possibly temporarily) had to quit my ADHD meds because of side effects, which *does not* help.\n* I\'m triggered because I\'m paying $1,000 a month for couples counseling. It\'s worth it, but that money was what I was saving for a car. I feel like it\'s just fucking impossible for me to get ahead. I\'ve got $2,500 in dental bills *more* to go this year; I\'m starting school in the spring, if I can get my brain working re: focus. Obviously, needing a beta blocker to get back on my ADHD meds is really helping this process.\n* I am in an arguably dangerous living situation that I have no way to exit in the foreseeable future. I feel like I\'m stuck here, and *screwed.* The fact that I can\'t drive actually makes this worse, because I\'ve been falsely imprisoned before (yes, really).\n* On top of it all? My only support system is contingent on my relationship with my fiancé. Every single person that I see in-person is someone that I know through my fiancé. It\'s like my entire life is centered around him, and I\'m some kind of accessory. How am I supposed to feel like anything else is going on, when I\'ve got no way to really develop my own social network until I can drive, and this has been my life for over 4 years?\n\nIt doesn\'t make sense. None of these things are really problems. My health is *improving.* I *have* $1,000 a month to spend on couples counseling, and that\'s a sign that I\'m actually doing really well despite being on disability benefits. I\'ve got a fiancé who is willing to go to couples counseling before we have some kind of actual crisis, and some kind of support system. But of course there\'s always some combination of serious problems going on that my brain just doesn\'t know how to deal with, and right now, this bullshit is on the list.\n\nWhich is why I have trouble even talking to people online. Because guess what? Once we get past the basics, I\'ve got nothing to say. People do not want to hear about whatever my brain has decided that I should be freaking out about. People cannot relate to my health struggles, or this infuriating waiting game that I\'ve been playing for over a year (where I\'m basically just waiting around for my next doctor\'s appointment, dose change, etc). They cannot relate to any of these problems, and often they can\'t even see why they\'re problems. *"Why don\'t you just go back to school, if that\'s what you want to do?"* (Because... I\'m disabled?)\n\nI\'ve also got 15 separate health conditions on top of that, and I\'ve learned that my health is actually way more fragile than I thought because I was born at 24 weeks with "an extremely low birth weight". So I can\'t even depend on my current health issues being stable. I found that out like a month ago, and I\'m just... still coming to terms with the fact that I\'m at a higher risk of contracting every known health condition, the circumstances of my birth have given me what researchers suggested should be labeled "a severe, lifelong, chronic condition" (which just causes other conditions), and on top of that, developing and then maintaining muscle is a struggle, so I have to get surgery for the hernia before I can take double the normal amount of protein that a normal person needs on a daily basis in order to actually make any progress with my rotator cuff injury.\n\nMy fiancé\'s mom has psychotic episodes every few years, and in some of those episodes, she\'s violent. She\'s attacked my fiancé with a knife. She\'s assaulted my sister. His family lies to the cops every single time she\'s psychotic so that she stays out of the hospital, putting all of them *and me, and his mom* in danger. So on top of everything, I live in a place where I constantly feel in danger, because at any time his mom could have a psychotic episode and try to murder me, and afterwards his entire family would lie to the police about what happened. And I\'ve got absolutely no way out of this living position for at least 3-5 years. But possibly longer.\n\nSee what I mean, about the bullshit?', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:56:49', 'subreddit': 'CPTSD', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1l80v67/one_of_the_worst_things_about_cptsd_is_that_im/'}

And because we rarely get time together alone, we aren’t intimate as often as I would like. Though I understand that he’s tired, it still sucks.

We asked my parents to take the kids this weekend, so we could spend time together. \n\nFriday, he still had stuff to do, so I went shopping. I decided to buy something sexy to wear, in hopes of maybe rekindling something, and thought he’d be excited. I went to several stores and spent hours trying to find something that I would feel comfortable and maybe even confident in. I told him I had a surprise, that I had taken the time to look for something cute, and that I was excited for him to see it. But he fell asleep that night as I was getting lotion and stuff on after a shower. Which was fine, I figured he was just tired. \n\nThe next day, on Saturday, we had a whole day at an amusement park planned out, but something happened and it didn’t turn out to be as fun as we hoped. We came home early, but it was a long drive, so I guess he was tired. He fell asleep again that night. \n\nWell, Sunday was the day we were picking up the kids. He never mentioned the “surprise”, even though I had brought it up several times. And when I brought up that we had only had sex once the whole weekend, which was Thursday night right after dropping the kids off, he just apologized. Then he went to the store to pick up some stuff we needed. When he got home, I said I was taking a shower, and he asked to join me. I didn’t really want him to, but said yes. Then, of course, he wanted to have sex. But honestly, it felt like a pity fuck. He only tried after I had expressed my frustration, and I just couldn’t get into it. But I couldn’t say no, either. \n\nNow I just feel so stupid for being so excited, for wasting my time looking for lingerie he had no interest in seeing me in, and I just feel so disgusting. He said before this weekend that he still wants me, and insisted that he is still attracted to me, but his actions speak louder than words. I think I’ll return it and buy some useful clothes instead.

My brother in law and his grandpa found her, and my husband saw her from the back (she was sitting in a wheelchair) before the coroner removed her body. I was spared that image in my head but I did come in after they had taken her out and saw her elderly father (husbands/BILs  grandpa) on his hands and knees lapping up her blood into a bucket. My husband was about to start helping too (he did wipe the blood from the table/chair she was sitting next to) and I really couldn’t stand the thought of the two of them having to do that. I made my husband leave, his grandpa is stubborn and wouldn’t go until the biggest part of the mess was up, but he and I pushed her blood into a bucket.

I have been in go mode but now that the funeral is over the gravity of what I have seen is really starting to catch up to me.

Our lives and our issues are *complex*. I dunno about you, but I\'m always having a series of personal crises that nobody has any idea how to relate to or deal with, and it\'s a real fucking struggle between shit like financial anxiety, a physically dangerous living situation, a variety of serious health issues, et cetera.\n\nI was watching a video where someone talked about their experience with self-worth and CPTSD a while back, and they talked about how, if you have CPTSD and you feel like you need more help than other people, it\'s because *you probably do* \\-- and you probably have fewer resources than other people to get that help. And you know what? They were fuckin\' right.\n\nI don\'t have extended family, or immediate family. I don\'t really have friends, because I live in a car dependent area and need to make some serious health improvements before I can actually learn to drive, so leaving the house is actually really expensive or time-consuming (uber is expensive, and the bus system is a 2 hour ride to get somewhere that\'s 20 minutes away by car). \n\nBut then, while I have people to talk to online, *what the fuck do I have to talk about?* Everything going on in my life right now is a dumb waiting game. I\'m waiting to see how the CPAP impacts my ability to function, because that takes up to 8 weeks. I\'m waiting 2.5 weeks to increase the dose of a new medication, and it\'ll be 7 more weeks until we know how well *that* works. I\'m waiting another week to talk to my PCP\'s PA about a beta blocker. I\'ve gotta schedule an appointment with a surgeon to talk about my hernia. I see a trauma therapist twice a week. My "personal project" right now is just *working on my own health and recovery.* \n\nAnd I am constantly having some kind of stupid fucking crisis. Right now, pick a thing: \n\n* I\'m triggered because I am constantly anhedonic, and struggle with focusing, and the medication for that requires 7 more weeks of waiting just to see if it works. And I (possibly temporarily) had to quit my ADHD meds because of side effects, which *does not* help.\n* I\'m triggered because I\'m paying $1,000 a month for couples counseling. It\'s worth it, but that money was what I was saving for a car. I feel like it\'s just fucking impossible for me to get ahead. I\'ve got $2,500 in dental bills *more* to go this year; I\'m starting school in the spring, if I can get my brain working re: focus. Obviously, needing a beta blocker to get back on my ADHD meds is really helping this process.\n* I am in an arguably dangerous living situation that I have no way to exit in the foreseeable future. I feel like I\'m stuck here, and *screwed.* The fact that I can\'t drive actually makes this worse, because I\'ve been falsely imprisoned before (yes, really).\n* On top of it all? My only support system is contingent on my relationship with my fiancé. Every single person that I see in-person is someone that I know through my fiancé. It\'s like my entire life is centered around him, and I\'m some kind of accessory. How am I supposed to feel like anything else is going on, when I\'ve got no way to really develop my own social network until I can drive, and this has been my life for over 4 years?\n\nIt doesn\'t make sense. None of these things are really problems. My health is *improving.* I *have* $1,000 a month to spend on couples counseling, and that\'s a sign that I\'m actually doing really well despite being on disability benefits. I\'ve got a fiancé who is willing to go to couples counseling before we have some kind of actual crisis, and some kind of support system. But of course there\'s always some combination of serious problems going on that my brain just doesn\'t know how to deal with, and right now, this bullshit is on the list.\n\nWhich is why I have trouble even talking to people online. Because guess what? Once we get past the basics, I\'ve got nothing to say. People do not want to hear about whatever my brain has decided that I should be freaking out about. People cannot relate to my health struggles, or this infuriating waiting game that I\'ve been playing for over a year (where I\'m basically just waiting around for my next doctor\'s appointment, dose change, etc). They cannot relate to any of these problems, and often they can\'t even see why they\'re problems. *"Why don\'t you just go back to school, if that\'s what you want to do?"* (Because... I\'m disabled?)\n\nI\'ve also got 15 separate health conditions on top of that, and I\'ve learned that my health is actually way more fragile than I thought because I was born at 24 weeks with "an extremely low birth weight". So I can\'t even depend on my current health issues being stable. I found that out like a month ago, and I\'m just... still coming to terms with the fact that I\'m at a higher risk of contracting every known health condition, the circumstances of my birth have given me what researchers suggested should be labeled "a severe, lifelong, chronic condition" (which just causes other conditions), and on top of that, developing and then maintaining muscle is a struggle, so I have to get surgery for the hernia before I can take double the normal amount of protein that a normal person needs on a daily basis in order to actually make any progress with my rotator cuff injury.\n\nMy fiancé\'s mom has psychotic episodes every few years, and in some of those episodes, she\'s violent. She\'s attacked my fiancé with a knife. She\'s assaulted my sister. His family lies to the cops every single time she\'s psychotic so that she stays out of the hospital, putting all of them *and me, and his mom* in danger. So on top of everything, I live in a place where I constantly feel in danger, because at any time his mom could have a psychotic episode and try to murder me, and afterwards his entire family would lie to the police about what happened. And I\'ve got absolutely no way out of this living position for at least 3-5 years. But possibly longer.\n\nSee what I mean, about the bullshit?', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:56:49', 'subreddit': 'CPTSD', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1l80v67/one_of_the_worst_things_about_cptsd_is_that_im/'}

I don\'t really have friends, because I live in a car dependent area and need to make some serious health improvements before I can actually learn to drive, so leaving the house is actually really expensive or time-consuming (uber is expensive, and the bus system is a 2 hour ride to get somewhere that\'s 20 minutes away by car). \n\nBut then, while I have people to talk to online, *what the fuck do I have to talk about?* Everything going on in my life right now is a dumb waiting game. I\'m waiting to see how the CPAP impacts my ability to function, because that takes up to 8 weeks. I\'m waiting 2.5 weeks to increase the dose of a new medication, and it\'ll be 7 more weeks until we know how well *that* works. I\'m waiting another week to talk to my PCP\'s PA about a beta blocker. I\'ve gotta schedule an appointment with a surgeon to talk about my hernia. I see a trauma therapist twice a week.

Right now, pick a thing: \n\n* I\'m triggered because I am constantly anhedonic, and struggle with focusing, and the medication for that requires 7 more weeks of waiting just to see if it works. And I (possibly temporarily) had to quit my ADHD meds because of side effects, which *does not* help.\n* I\'m triggered because I\'m paying $1,000 a month for couples counseling. It\'s worth it, but that money was what I was saving for a car. I feel like it\'s just fucking impossible for me to get ahead. I\'ve got $2,500 in dental bills *more* to go this year; I\'m starting school in the spring, if I can get my brain working re: focus. Obviously, needing a beta blocker to get back on my ADHD meds is really helping this process.\n* I am in an arguably dangerous living situation that I have no way to exit in the foreseeable future. I feel like I\'m stuck here, and *screwed.* The fact that I can\'t drive actually makes this worse, because I\'ve been falsely imprisoned before (yes, really).\n* On top of it all? My only support system is contingent on my relationship with my fiancé. Every single person that I see in-person is someone that I know through my fiancé. It\'s like my entire life is centered around him, and I\'m some kind of accessory. How am I supposed to feel like anything else is going on, when I\'ve got no way to really develop my own social network until I can drive, and this has been my life for over 4 years?\n\nIt doesn\'t make sense. None of these things are really problems. My health is *improving.* I *have* $1,000 a month to spend on couples counseling, and that\'s a sign that I\'m actually doing really well despite being on disability benefits. I\'ve got a fiancé who is willing to go to couples counseling before we have some kind of actual crisis, and some kind of support system. But of course there\'s always some combination of serious problems going on that my brain just doesn\'t know how to deal with, and right now, this bullshit is on the list.\n\nWhich is why I have trouble even talking to people online. Because guess what? Once we get past the basics, I\'ve got nothing to say. People do not want to hear about whatever my brain has decided that I should be freaking out about. People cannot relate to my health struggles, or this infuriating waiting game that I\'ve been playing for over a year (where I\'m basically just waiting around for my next doctor\'s appointment, dose change, etc). They cannot relate to any of these problems, and often they can\'t even see why they\'re problems. *"Why don\'t you just go back to school, if that\'s what you want to do?"* (Because... I\'m disabled?)\n\nI\'ve also got 15 separate health conditions on top of that, and I\'ve learned that my health is actually way more fragile than I thought because I was born at 24 weeks with "an extremely low birth weight". So I can\'t even depend on my current health issues being stable. I found that out like a month ago, and I\'m just... still coming to terms with the fact that I\'m at a higher risk of contracting every known health condition, the circumstances of my birth have given me what researchers suggested should be labeled "a severe, lifelong, chronic condition" (which just causes other conditions), and on top of that, developing and then maintaining muscle is a struggle, so I have to get surgery for the hernia before I can take double the normal amount of protein that a normal person needs on a daily basis in order to actually make any progress with my rotator cuff injury.\n\nMy fiancé\'s mom has psychotic episodes every few years, and in some of those episodes, she\'s violent. She\'s attacked my fiancé with a knife. She\'s assaulted my sister. His family lies to the cops every single time she\'s psychotic so that she stays out of the hospital, putting all of them *and me, and his mom* in danger. So on top of everything, I live in a place where I constantly feel in danger, because at any time his mom could have a psychotic episode and try to murder me, and afterwards his entire family would lie to the police about what happened. And I\'ve got absolutely no way out of this living position for at least 3-5 years. But possibly longer.\n\nSee what I mean, about the bullshit?', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T14:56:49', 'subreddit': 'CPTSD', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1l80v67/one_of_the_worst_things_about_cptsd_is_that_im/'}

We have two young children, both under school age, and I am a SAHM. He is still in school and works, so he’s gone most of the time on weekdays, and of course still has to spend time studying while at home. It has been hard on my mental health, being the one doing most of the childcare, even though he helps as much as he can. And because we rarely get time together alone, we aren’t intimate as often as I would like. Though I understand that he’s tired, it still sucks. I have communicated to him several times how I feel ugly and unwanted, and my self-esteem and mental health have both taken some pretty heavy hits the past few months. He agreed to try working on this, or at least trying to communicate better so I won’t be constantly disappointed when he falls asleep before I even get to bed. We asked my parents to take the kids this weekend, so we could spend time together. \n\nFriday, he still had stuff to do, so I went shopping. I decided to buy something sexy to wear, in hopes of maybe rekindling something, and thought he’d be excited. I went to several stores and spent hours trying to find something that I would feel comfortable and maybe even confident in. I told him I had a surprise, that I had taken the time to look for something cute, and that I was excited for him to see it. But he fell asleep that night as I was getting lotion and stuff on after a shower. Which was fine, I figured he was just tired. \n\nThe next day, on Saturday, we had a whole day at an amusement park planned out, but something happened and it didn’t turn out to be as fun as we hoped. We came home early, but it was a long drive, so I guess he was tired. He fell asleep again that night. \n\nWell, Sunday was the day we were picking up the kids. He never mentioned the “surprise”, even though I had brought it up several times. And when I brought up that we had only had sex once the whole weekend, which was Thursday night right after dropping the kids off, he just apologized. Then he went to the store to pick up some stuff we needed. When he got home, I said I was taking a shower, and he asked to join me. I didn’t really want him to, but said yes. Then, of course, he wanted to have sex. But honestly, it felt like a pity fuck. He only tried after I had expressed my frustration, and I just couldn’t get into it. But I couldn’t say no, either. \n\nNow I just feel so stupid for being so excited, for wasting my time looking for lingerie he had no interest in seeing me in, and I just feel so disgusting. He said before this weekend that he still wants me, and insisted that he is still attracted to me, but his actions speak louder than words. I think I’ll return it and buy some useful clothes instead. I already have enough unused lace in my drawers, and none of it looks good on me anyway.', 'timestamp': '2025-06-10T16:05:22', 'subreddit': 'offmychest', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l82mdw/i_feel_more_unwanted_than_ever_after_a_kidfree/'}

I\'m disabled?)\n\nI\'ve also got 15 separate health conditions on top of that, and I\'ve learned that my health is actually way more fragile than I thought because I was born at 24 weeks with "an extremely low birth weight". So I can\'t even depend on my current health issues being stable. I found that out like a month ago, and I\'m just... still coming to terms with the fact that I\'m at a higher risk of contracting every known health condition, the circumstances of my birth have given me what researchers suggested should be labeled "a severe, lifelong, chronic condition" (which just causes other conditions), and on top of that, developing and then maintaining muscle is a struggle, so I have to get surgery for the hernia before I can take double the normal amount of protein that a normal person needs on a daily basis in order to actually make any progress with my rotator cuff injury.\n\nMy fiancé\'s mom has psychotic episodes every few years, and in some of those episodes, she\'s violent. She\'s attacked my fiancé with a knife. She\'s assaulted my sister. His family lies to the cops every single time she\'s psychotic so that she stays out of the hospital, putting all of them *and me, and his mom* in danger. So on top of everything, I live in a place where I constantly feel in danger, because at any time his mom could have a psychotic episode and try to murder me, and afterwards his entire family would lie to the police about what happened.

Our lives and our issues are *complex*. I dunno about you, but I\'m always having a series of personal crises that nobody has any idea how to relate to or deal with, and it\'s a real fucking struggle between shit like financial anxiety, a physically dangerous living situation, a variety of serious health issues, et cetera.\n\nI was watching a video where someone talked about their experience with self-worth and CPTSD a while back, and they talked about how, if you have CPTSD and you feel like you need more help than other people, it\'s because *you probably do* \\-- and you probably have fewer resources than other people to get that help. And you know what? They were fuckin\' right.\n\nI don\'t have extended family, or immediate family. I don\'t really have friends, because I live in a car dependent area and need to make some serious health improvements before I can actually learn to drive, so leaving the house is actually really expensive or time-consuming (uber is expensive, and the bus system is a 2 hour ride to get somewhere that\'s 20 minutes away by car). \n\nBut then, while I have people to talk to online, *what the fuck do I have to talk about?* Everything going on in my life right now is a dumb waiting game. I\'m waiting to see how the CPAP impacts my ability to function, because that takes up to 8 weeks. I\'m waiting 2.5 weeks to increase the dose of a new medication, and it\'ll be 7 more weeks until we know how well *that* works. I\'m waiting another week to talk to my PCP\'s PA about a beta blocker. I\'ve gotta schedule an appointment with a surgeon to talk about my hernia. I see a trauma therapist twice a week. My "personal project" right now is just *working on my own health and recovery.* \n\nAnd I am constantly having some kind of stupid fucking crisis. Right now, pick a thing: \n\n* I\'m triggered because I am constantly anhedonic, and struggle with focusing, and the medication for that requires 7 more weeks of waiting just to see if it works. And I (possibly temporarily) had to quit my ADHD meds because of side effects, which *does not* help.\n* I\'m triggered because I\'m paying $1,000 a month for couples counseling. It\'s worth it, but that money was what I was saving for a car. I feel like it\'s just fucking impossible for me to get ahead. I\'ve got $2,500 in dental bills *more* to go this year; I\'m starting school in the spring, if I can get my brain working re: focus. Obviously, needing a beta blocker to get back on my ADHD meds is really helping this process.\n* I am in an arguably dangerous living situation that I have no way to exit in the foreseeable future. I feel like I\'m stuck here, and *screwed.* The fact that I can\'t drive actually makes this worse, because I\'ve been falsely imprisoned before (yes, really).\n* On top of it all? My only support system is contingent on my relationship with my fiancé. Every single person that I see in-person is someone that I know through my fiancé. It\'s like my entire life is centered around him, and I\'m some kind of accessory. How am I supposed to feel like anything else is going on, when I\'ve got no way to really develop my own social network until I can drive, and this has been my life for over 4 years?\n\nIt doesn\'t make sense.

Mind you, I came up with that name for a boy and his mother also wanted us to name our child August, but for a girl. I feel kinda hurt about it which I shouldn't.

" or other girls ridiculing existence of those childish things? \n\n\n That made me think, pretty much everything that is associated with girls is considered cringe. Shopping , makeup, music, now mental disorders, everything like that is hated. \n\nMeanwhile childish things for boys are considered a "legend", like video games, starwars (im NOT saying only boys should play them but theyre obviously male oriented) \nEven things like dota2, LoL, HOI4 while ridiculed, still isnt considered cringe and you wont see people destroying stuff just to piss their fans off. Theres considerably less hated male interests\n\nIts fucking annoying, even while i have little "feminine" interests, i still dont wanna live in the world where whatever is related to me is considered cringe because of my sex', 'timestamp': '2025-06-11T08:31:37', 'subreddit': 'offmychest', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l8nep4/its_annoying_how_anything_girls_like_is_hated/'}
